Paladins are united by their oaths to stand against the forces of annihilation and corruption. Whether sworn before a god’s altar, in a sacred glade before nature spirits, or in a moment of desperation and grief with the dead as the only witnesses, a Paladin’s oath is a powerful bond. It is a source of power that turns a devout warrior into a blessed champion.

Paladins train to learn the skills of combat, mastering a variety of weapons and armor. Even so, their martial skills are secondary to the magical power they wield: power to heal the injured, smite their foes, and protect the helpless and those who fight at their side.

Almost by definition, the life of a Paladin is an adventuring life, for every Paladin lives on the front lines of the cosmic struggle against annihilation. Fighters are rare enough among the ranks of a world’s armies, but even fewer people can claim the calling of a Paladin. When they do receive the call, these blessed folk turn from their former occupations and take up arms and magic.

#### [](#Level1LayOnHands)Level 1: Lay On Hands

Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest). With that pool, you can restore a total number of Hit Points equal to five times your Paladin level.

As a Bonus Action, you can touch a creature (which could be yourself) and draw power from the pool of healing to restore a number of Hit Points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in the pool.

You can also expend 5 Hit Points from the pool of healing power to remove the [Poisoned](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#PoisonedCondition) condition from the creature; those points don’t also restore Hit Points to the creature.

#### [](#Level1PaladinSpellcasting)Level 1: Spellcasting

You have learned to cast spells through prayer and meditation. See [chapter 7](/sources/dnd/phb-2024/spells/) for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Paladin spells, which appear in the [Paladin spell list](#PaladinSpellList) later in the class’s description.

**_Spell Slots._** The [Paladin Features table](#PaladinFeatures) shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

**_Prepared Spells of Level 1+_**. You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Paladin spells. [Heroism](/spells/2619151-heroism) and [Searing Smite](/spells/2619009-searing-smite) are recommended.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Paladin levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the [Paladin Features table](#PaladinFeatures). Whenever that number increases, choose additional Paladin spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the Paladin Features table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 5 Paladin, your list of prepared spells can include six Paladin spells of level 1 or 2 in any combination.

If another Paladin feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Paladin spells for you.

**_Changing Your Prepared Spells._** Whenever you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest), you can replace one spell on your list with another Paladin spell for which you have spell slots.

**_Spellcasting Ability._** Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Paladin spells.

**_Spellcasting Focus._** You can use a [Holy Symbol](/equipment/514-holy-symbol) as a Spellcasting Focus for your Paladin spells.

#### [](#Level1PaladinWeaponMastery)Level 1: Weapon Mastery

Your training with weapons allows you to use the [mastery properties](/sources/dnd/phb-2024/equipment#MasteryProperties) of two kinds of weapons of your choice with which you have proficiency, such as Longswords and Javelins.

Whenever you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest), you can change the kinds of weapons you chose. For example, you could switch to using the mastery properties of Halberds and Flails.

#### [](#Level2PaladinFightingStyle)Level 2: Fighting Style

You gain a Fighting Style feat of your choice (see [chapter 5](/sources/dnd/phb-2024/feats#FightingStyleFeats) for feats). Instead of choosing one of those feats, you can choose the option below.

**_Blessed Warrior._** You learn two Cleric cantrips of your choice (see the Cleric class’s section for a [list of Cleric spells](/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#ClericSpellList)). [Guidance](/spells/2618971-guidance) and [Sacred Flame](/spells/2618967-sacred-flame) are recommended. The chosen cantrips count as Paladin spells for you, and Charisma is your spellcasting ability for them. Whenever you gain a Paladin level, you can replace one of these cantrips with another Cleric cantrip.

#### [](#Level2PaladinsSmite)Level 2: Paladin’s Smite

You always have the [Divine Smite](/spells/2618833-divine-smite) spell prepared. In addition, you can cast it without expending a spell slot, but you must finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest) before you can cast it in this way again.

#### [](#Level3ChannelDivinity)Level 3: Channel Divinity

You can channel divine energy directly from the Outer Planes, using it to fuel magical effects. You start with one such effect: Divine Sense, which is described below. Other Paladin features give additional Channel Divinity effect options. Each time you use this class’s Channel Divinity, you choose which effect from this class to create.

You can use this class’s Channel Divinity twice. You regain one of its expended uses when you finish a [Short Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest). You gain an additional use when you reach Paladin level 11.

If a Channel Divinity effect requires a saving throw, the DC equals the spell save DC from this class’s Spellcasting feature.

**_Divine Sense._** As a Bonus Action, you can open your awareness to detect Celestials, Fiends, and Undead. For the next 10 minutes or until you have the [Incapacitated](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition, you know the location of any creature of those types within 60 feet of yourself, and you know its creature type. Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the [Hallow](/spells/2619138-hallow) spell.

#### [](#Level3PaladinSubclass)Level 3: Paladin Subclass

You gain a Paladin subclass of your choice. The [Oath of Devotion](#OathofDevotion), [Oath of Glory](#OathofGlory), [Oath of the Ancients](#OathoftheAncients), and [Oath of Vengeance](#OathofVengeance) subclasses are detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Paladin levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Paladin level or lower.

Breaking Your Oath

A Paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most dedicated are fallible. Sometimes a Paladin transgresses their oath.

A Paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution, spending an all-night vigil as a sign of penitence or undertaking a fast. After a rite of forgiveness, the Paladin starts fresh.

If your Paladin unrepentantly violates their oath, talk to your DM. Your Paladin should probably take a more appropriate subclass or even abandon the class and adopt another one.

#### [](#Level4PaladinAbilityScoreImprovement)Level 4: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see [chapter 5](/sources/dnd/phb-2024/feats#AbilityScoreImprovement)) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Paladin levels 8, 12, and 16.

#### [](#Level5PaladinExtraAttack)Level 5: Extra Attack

You can attack twice instead of once whenever you take the [Attack](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#AttackAction) action on your turn.

#### [](#Level5FaithfulSteed)Level 5: Faithful Steed

You can call on the aid of an otherworldly steed. You always have the [Find Steed](/spells/2618879-find-steed) spell prepared.

You can also cast the spell once without expending a spell slot, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

cause manifests as magical might

#### [](#Level6AuraofProtection)Level 6: Aura of Protection

You radiate a protective, unseeable aura in a 10-foot [Emanation](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#EmanationAreaofEffect) that originates from you. The aura is inactive while you have the [Incapacitated](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition.

You and your allies in the aura gain a bonus to saving throws equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum bonus of +1).

If another Paladin is present, a creature can benefit from only one Aura of Protection at a time; the creature chooses which aura while in them.

#### [](#Level9AbjureFoes)Level 9: Abjure Foes

As a [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action, you can expend one use of this class’s Channel Divinity to overwhelm foes with awe. As you present your Holy Symbol or weapon, you can target a number of creatures equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature) that you can see within 60 feet of yourself. Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the [Frightened](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition) condition for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. While Frightened in this way, a target can do only one of the following on its turns: move, take an action, or take a Bonus Action.

#### [](#Level10AuraofCourage)Level 10: Aura of Courage

You and your allies have Immunity to the [Frightened](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition) condition while in your Aura of Protection. If a Frightened ally enters the aura, that condition has no effect on that ally while there.

#### [](#Level11RadiantStrikes)Level 11: Radiant Strikes

Your strikes now carry supernatural power. When you hit a target with an attack roll using a Melee weapon or an [Unarmed Strike](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike), the target takes an extra 1d8 Radiant damage.

#### [](#Level14RestoringTouch)Level 14: Restoring Touch

When you use Lay On Hands on a creature, you can also remove one or more of the following conditions from the creature: [Blinded](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BlindedCondition), [Charmed](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CharmedCondition), [Deafened](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DeafenedCondition), [Frightened](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition), [Paralyzed](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ParalyzedCondition), or [Stunned](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#StunnedCondition). You must expend 5 Hit Points from the healing pool of Lay On Hands for each of these conditions you remove; those points don’t also restore Hit Points to the creature.

#### [](#Level18AuraExpansion)Level 18: Aura Expansion

Your Aura of Protection is now a 30-foot [Emanation](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#EmanationAreaofEffect).

#### [](#Level19PaladinEpicBoon)Level 19: Epic Boon

You gain an Epic Boon feat (see [chapter 5](/sources/dnd/phb-2024/feats#EpicBoonFeats)) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. [Boon of Truesight](/sources/dnd/phb-2024/feats#BoonofsenseTruesightsense) is recommended.

### [](#PaladinSpellList)Paladin Spell List

This section presents the Paladin spell list. The spells are organized by spell level and then alphabetized, and each spell’s school of magic is listed. In the Special column, _C_ means the spell requires Concentration, _R_ means it’s a Ritual, and _M_ means it requires a specific Material component.

### [](#PaladinSubclasses)Paladin Subclasses

A Paladin subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Paladin levels, as specified in the subclass. This section presents the [Oath of Devotion](#OathofDevotion), [Oath of Glory](#OathofGlory), [Oath of the Ancients](#OathoftheAncients), and [Oath of Vengeance](#OathofVengeance) subclasses.

Each of these subclasses represents a body of oaths that a Paladin begins taking upon joining the class. The final oath, taken at level 3, is the culmination of a Paladin’s training. Some characters with this class don’t consider themselves true Paladins until they’ve reached level 3 and made this oath. For others, the swearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what was already in their hearts.

#### [](#OathofDevotion)Oath of Devotion

_Uphold the Ideals of Justice and Order_

The Oath of Devotion binds Paladins to the ideals of justice and order. These Paladins meet the archetype of the knight in shining armor. They hold themselves to the highest standards of conduct, and some—for better or worse—hold the rest of the world to the same standards.

Many who swear this oath are devoted to gods of law and good and use their gods’ tenets as the measure of personal devotion. Others hold angels as their ideals and incorporate images of angelic wings into their helmets or coats of arms.

These paladins share the following tenets:

*   Let your word be your promise.
*   Protect the weak and never fear to act.
*   Let your honorable deeds be an example.

##### [](#Level3OathofDevotionSpells)Level 3: Oath of Devotion Spells

The magic of your oath ensures you always have certain spells ready; when you reach a Paladin level specified in the Oath of Devotion Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

##### [](#Level3SacredWeapon)Level 3: Sacred Weapon

When you take the [Attack](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#AttackAction) action, you can expend one use of your Channel Divinity to imbue one Melee weapon that you are holding with positive energy. For 10 minutes or until you use this feature again, you add your Charisma modifier to attack rolls you make with that weapon (minimum bonus of +1), and each time you hit with it, you cause it to deal its normal damage type or Radiant damage.

The weapon also emits [Bright Light](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BrightLight) in a 20-foot radius and [Dim Light](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DimLight) 20 feet beyond that.

You can end this effect early (no action required). This effect also ends if you aren’t carrying the weapon.

##### [](#Level7AuraofDevotion)Level 7: Aura of Devotion

You and your allies have Immunity to the [Charmed](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CharmedCondition) condition while in your Aura of Protection. If a Charmed ally enters the aura, that condition has no effect on that ally while there.

##### [](#Level15SmiteofProtection)Level 15: Smite of Protection

Your magical smite now radiates protective energy. Whenever you cast [Divine Smite](/spells/2618833-divine-smite), you and your allies have [Half Cover](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Cover) while in your Aura of Protection. The aura has this benefit until the start of your next turn.

##### [](#Level20HolyNimbus)Level 20: Holy Nimbus

As a Bonus Action, you can imbue your Aura of Protection with holy power, granting the benefits below for 10 minutes or until you end them (no action required).

You can also restore your use of it by expending a level 5 spell slot (no action required).

#### [](#OathofGlory)Oath of Glory

_Strive for the Heights of Heroism_

Paladins who take the Oath of Glory believe they and their companions are destined to achieve glory through deeds of heroism. They train diligently and encourage their companions, so they’re all ready when destiny calls.

The total number of Temporary Hit Points equals 2d8 plus your Paladin level, divided among the chosen creatures however you like.

##### [](#Level3OathofGlorySpells)Level 3: Oath of Glory Spells

The magic of your oath ensures you always have certain spells ready; when you reach a Paladin level specified in the Oath of Glory Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

For 1 hour, you have [Advantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Advantage) on Strength ([Athletics](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) and Dexterity ([Acrobatics](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) checks, and the distance of your [Long](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongJump) and [High Jumps](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#HighJump) increases by 10 feet (this extra distance costs movement as normal).

##### [](#Level7AuraofAlacrity)Level 7: Aura of Alacrity

Your Speed increases by 10 feet.

In addition, whenever an ally enters your Aura of Protection for the first time on a turn or starts their turn there, the ally’s Speed increases by 10 feet until the end of their next turn.

##### [](#Level15GloriousDefense)Level 15: Glorious Defense

You can turn defense into a sudden strike. When you or another creature you can see within 10 feet of you is hit by an attack roll, you can take a Reaction to grant a bonus to the target’s AC against that attack, potentially causing it to miss. The bonus equals your Charisma modifier (minimum of +1). If the attack misses, you can make one attack with a weapon against the attacker as part of this Reaction if the attacker is within your weapon’s range.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

##### [](#Level20LivingLegend)Level 20: Living Legend

**_Unerring Strike._** Once on each of your turns when you make an attack roll with a weapon and miss, you can cause that attack to hit instead.

#### [](#OathoftheAncients)Oath of the Ancients

_Preserve Life and Light in the World_

The Oath of the Ancients is as old as the first elves. Paladins who swear this oath cherish the light; they love the beautiful and life-giving things of the world more than any principles of honor, courage, and justice. They often adorn their armor and clothing with images of growing things—leaves, antlers, or flowers—to reflect their commitment to preserving life and light.

These paladins share the following tenets:

*   Kindle the light of hope.
*   Shelter life.
*   Delight in art and laughter.

##### [](#Level3NaturesWrath)Level 3: Nature’s Wrath

As a [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action, you can expend one use of your Channel Divinity to conjure spectral vines around nearby creatures. Each creature of your choice that you can see within 15 feet of yourself must succeed on a Strength saving throw or have the [Restrained](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#RestrainedCondition) condition for 1 minute. A Restrained creature repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

##### [](#Level3OathoftheAncientsSpells)Level 3: Oath of the Ancients Spells

##### [](#Level7AuraofWarding)Level 7: Aura of Warding

Additionally, you can’t be aged magically, and you cease visibly aging.

##### [](#Level20ElderChampion)Level 20: Elder Champion

As a Bonus Action, you can imbue your Aura of Protection with primal power, granting the benefits below for 1 minute or until you end them (no action required). Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest). You can also restore your use of it by expending a level 5 spell slot (no action required).

**_Diminish Defiance._** Enemies in the aura have [Disadvantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Disadvantage) on saving throws against your spells and Channel Divinity options.

**_Swift Spells._** Whenever you cast a spell that has a casting time of an action, you can cast it using a Bonus Action instead.

#### [](#OathofVengeance)Oath of Vengeance

_Punish Evildoers at Any Cost_

The Oath of Vengeance is a solemn commitment to punish those who have committed grievously evil acts. When evil armies slaughter helpless villagers, when a tyrant defies the will of the gods, when a thieves’ guild grows too violent, when a dragon rampages through the countryside—at times like these, paladins arise and swear an Oath of Vengeance to set right what has gone wrong.

##### [](#Level7RelentlessAvenger)Level 7: Relentless Avenger

You can then move up to half your Speed as part of the same Reaction. This movement doesn’t provoke Opportunity Attacks.

Far from bustling cities, amid the trees of trackless forests and across wide plains, Rangers keep their unending watch in the wilderness. Rangers learn to track their quarry as a predator does, moving stealthily through the wilds and hiding themselves in brush and rubble.

Thanks to their connection with nature, Rangers can also cast spells that harness primal powers of the wilderness. A Ranger’s talents and magic are honed with deadly focus to protect the world from the ravages of monsters and tyrants.

#### [](#Level1RangerSpellcasting)Level 1: Spellcasting

You have learned to channel the magical essence of nature to cast spells. See [chapter 7](/sources/dnd/phb-2024/spells/) for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Ranger spells, which appear in the [Ranger spell list](#RangerSpellList) later in the class’s description.

**_Spell Slots._** The [Ranger Features table](#RangerFeatures) shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

**_Prepared Spells of Level 1+_**. You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Ranger spells. [Cure Wounds](/spells/2619079-cure-wounds) and [Ensnaring Strike](/spells/2619172-ensnaring-strike) are recommended.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Ranger levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the [Ranger Features table](#RangerFeatures). Whenever that number increases, choose additional Ranger spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the Ranger Features table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 5 Ranger, your list of prepared spells can include six Ranger spells of level 1 or 2 in any combination.

If another Ranger feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Ranger spells for you.

**_Changing Your Prepared Spells._** Whenever you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest), you can replace one spell on your list with another Ranger spell for which you have spell slots.

**_Spellcasting Ability._** Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Ranger spells.

**_Spellcasting Focus._** You can use a [Druidic Focus](/equipment/532-druidic-focus) as a Spellcasting Focus for your Ranger spells.

#### [](#Level1FavoredEnemy)Level 1: Favored Enemy

You always have the [Hunter’s Mark](/spells/2619166-hunters-mark) spell prepared. You can cast it twice without expending a spell slot, and you regain all expended uses of this ability when you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

The number of times you can cast the spell without a spell slot increases when you reach certain Ranger levels, as shown in the Favored Enemy column of the [Ranger Features table](#RangerFeatures).

#### [](#Level1RangerWeaponMastery)Level 1: Weapon Mastery

Your training with weapons allows you to use the [mastery properties](/sources/dnd/phb-2024/equipment#MasteryProperties) of two kinds of weapons of your choice with which you have proficiency, such as Longbows and Shortswords.

Whenever you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest), you can change the kinds of weapons you chose. For example, you could switch to using the mastery properties of Scimitars and Longswords.

**_Druidic Warrior._** You learn two Druid cantrips of your choice (see the Druid class’s section for a [list of Druid spells](/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#DruidSpellList)). [Guidance](/spells/2618971-guidance) and [Starry Wisp](/spells/2618840-starry-wisp) are recommended. The chosen cantrips count as Ranger spells for you, and Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for them. Whenever you gain a Ranger level, you can replace one of these cantrips with another Druid cantrip.

#### [](#Level3RangerSubclass)Level 3: Ranger Subclass

You gain a Ranger subclass of your choice.The [Beast Master](#BeastMaster), [Fey Wanderer](#FeyWanderer), [Gloom Stalker](#GloomStalker), and [Hunter](#Hunter) subclasses are detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Ranger levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Ranger level or lower.

#### [](#Level4RangerAbilityScoreImprovement)Level 4: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see [chapter 5](/sources/dnd/phb-2024/feats#AbilityScoreImprovement)) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Ranger levels 8, 12, and 16.

**_Temporary Hit Points._** As a [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action, you can give yourself a number of [Temporary Hit Points](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#TemporaryHitPoints) equal to 1d8 plus your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1).

Beast Master Subclass

##### [](#Level3PrimalCompanion)Level 3: Primal Companion

You magically summon a primal beast, which draws strength from your bond with nature. Choose its stat block: **[Beast of the Land](#BeastoftheLand)**, **[Beast of the Sea](#BeastoftheSea)**, or **[Beast of the Sky](#BeastoftheSky)**. You also determine the kind of animal it is, choosing a kind appropriate for the stat block. Whatever beast you choose, it bears primal markings indicating its supernatural origin.

The beast is [Friendly](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FriendlyAttitude) to you and your allies and obeys your commands. It vanishes if you die.

**_The Beast in Combat._** In combat, the beast acts during your turn. It can move and use its Reaction on its own, but the only action it takes is the [Dodge](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DodgeAction) action unless you take a Bonus Action to command it to take an action in its stat block or some other action. You can also sacrifice one of your attacks when you take the [Attack](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#AttackAction) action to command the beast to take the Beast’s Strike action. If you have the [Incapacitated](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition, the beast acts on its own and isn’t limited to the Dodge action.

**_Restoring or Replacing the Beast._** If the beast has died within the last hour, you can take a [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action to touch it and expend a spell slot. The beast returns to life after 1 minute with all its Hit Points restored.

Whenever you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest), you can summon a different primal beast, which appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. You choose its stat block and appearance. If you already have a beast from this feature, the old one vanishes when the new one appears.

Rogues rely on cunning, stealth, and their foes’ vulnerabilities to get the upper hand in any situation. They have a knack for finding the solution to just about any problem. A few even learn magical tricks to supplement their other abilities. Many Rogues focus on stealth and deception, while others refine skills that help them in a dungeon environment, such as climbing, finding and disarming traps, and opening locks.

In combat, Rogues prioritize subtle strikes over brute strength. They would rather make one precise strike than wear an opponent down with a barrage of blows.

Some Rogues began their careers as criminals, while others used their cunning to fight crime. Whatever a Rogue’s relation to the law, no common criminal or officer of the law can match the subtle brilliance of the greatest Rogues.

**_Prepared Spells of Level 1+._** You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose three level 1 Wizard spells. [Charm Person](/spells/2618964-charm-person), [Disguise Self](/spells/2619102-disguise-self), and [Fog Cloud](/spells/2618910-fog-cloud) are recommended.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Rogue levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Arcane Trickster Spellcasting table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Wizard spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the Arcane Trickster Spellcasting table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 7 Rogue, your list of prepared spells can include five Wizard spells of level 1 or 2 in any combination.

**_Changing Your Prepared Spells._** Whenever you gain a Rogue level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Wizard spell for which you have spell slots.

**_Spellcasting Ability._** Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Wizard spells.

**_Spellcasting Focus._** You can use an [Arcane Focus](/equipment/544-arcane-focus) as a Spellcasting Focus for your Wizard spells.

##### [](#Level3MageHandLegerdemain)Level 3: Mage Hand Legerdemain

When you cast [Mage Hand](/spells/2619008-mage-hand), you can cast it as a Bonus Action, and you can make the spectral hand [Invisible](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#InvisibleCondition). You can control the hand as a Bonus Action, and through it, you can make Dexterity ([Sleight of Hand](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) checks.

##### [](#Level9MagicalAmbush)Level 9: Magical Ambush

If you have the [Invisible](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#InvisibleCondition) condition when you cast a spell on a creature, it has [Disadvantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Disadvantage) on any saving throw it makes against the spell on the same turn.

##### [](#Level13VersatileTrickster)Level 13: Versatile Trickster

You gain the ability to distract targets with your [Mage Hand](/spells/2619008-mage-hand). When you use the Trip option of your Cunning Strike on a creature, you can also use that option on another creature within 5 feet of the spectral hand.

##### [](#Level17SpellThief)Level 17: Spell Thief

You gain the ability to magically steal the knowledge of how to cast a spell from another spellcaster.

Immediately after a creature casts a spell that targets you or includes you in its area of effect, you can take a Reaction to force the creature to make an Intelligence saving throw. The DC equals your spell save DC. On a failed save, you negate the spell’s effect against you, and you steal the knowledge of the spell if it is at least level 1 and of a level you can cast (it doesn’t need to be a Wizard spell). For the next 8 hours, you have the spell prepared. The creature can’t cast it until the 8 hours have passed.

Once you steal a spell with this feature, you can’t use this feature again until you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

#### [](#Assassin)Assassin

_Practice the Grim Art of Death_

An Assassin’s training focuses on using stealth, poison, and disguise to eliminate foes with deadly efficiency. While some Rogues who follow this path are hired killers, spies, or bounty hunters, the capabilities of this subclass are equally useful for adventurers facing a variety of monstrous enemies.

Assassin Subclass

##### [](#Level3Assassinate)Level 3: Assassinate

You’re adept at ambushing a target, granting you the following benefits.

**_Initiative._** You have [Advantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Advantage) on Initiative rolls.

**_Surprising Strikes._** During the first round of each combat, you have [Advantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Advantage) on attack rolls against any creature that hasn’t taken a turn. If your Sneak Attack hits any target during that round, the target takes extra damage of the weapon’s type equal to your Rogue level.

##### [](#Level3AssassinsTools)Level 3: Assassin’s Tools

You gain a [Disguise Kit](/equipment/542-disguise-kit) and a [Poisoner’s Kit](/equipment/492-poisoners-kit), and you have proficiency with them.

##### [](#Level9InfiltrationExpertise)Level 9: Infiltration Expertise

You are expert at the following techniques that aid your infiltrations.

**_Masterful Mimicry._** You can unerringly mimic another person’s speech, handwriting, or both if you have spent at least 1 hour studying them.

**_Roving Aim._** Your Speed isn’t reduced to 0 by using Steady Aim.

##### [](#Level13EnvenomWeapons)Level 13: Envenom Weapons

When you use the Poison option of your Cunning Strike, the target also takes 2d6 Poison damage whenever it fails the saving throw. This damage ignores Resistance to Poison damage.

##### [](#Level17DeathStrike)Level 17: Death Strike

When you hit with your Sneak Attack on the first round of a combat, the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 plus your Dexterity modifier and Proficiency Bonus), or the attack’s damage is doubled against the target.

#### [](#Soulknife)Soulknife

_Strike Foes with Psionic Blades_

A Soulknife strikes with the mind, cutting through barriers both physical and psychic. These Rogues discover psionic power within themselves and channel it to do their roguish work. As a Soulknife, your psionic abilities might have haunted you since childhood, revealing their full potential only as you experienced the stress of adventure. Or you might have sought out an order of psychic adepts and spent years learning how to manifest your power.

##### [](#Level3PsionicPower)Level 3: Psionic Power

You harbor a wellspring of psionic energy within yourself. It is represented by your Psionic Energy Dice, which fuel certain powers you have from this subclass. The Soulknife Energy Dice table shows the number of these dice you have when you reach certain Rogue levels, and the table shows the die size.

Soulknife Subclass

Any features in this subclass that use a Psionic Energy Die use only the dice from this subclass. Some of your powers expend a Psionic Energy Die, as specified in a power’s description, and you can’t use a power if it requires you to use a die when your Psionic Energy Dice are all expended.

You regain one of your expended Psionic Energy Dice when you finish a [Short Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest), and you regain all of them when you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

**_Psi-Bolstered Knack._** If you fail an ability check using a skill or tool with which you have proficiency, you can roll one Psionic Energy Die and add the number rolled to the check, potentially turning failure into success. The die is expended only if the roll then succeeds.

**_Psychic Whispers._** You can establish telepathic communication between yourself and others. As a [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action, choose one or more creatures you can see, up to a number of creatures equal to your Proficiency Bonus, and then roll one Psionic Energy Die. For a number of hours equal to the number rolled, the chosen creatures can speak telepathically with you, and you can speak telepathically with them. To send or receive a message (no action required), you and the other creature must be within 1 mile of each other. A creature can end the telepathic connection at any time (no action required).

The first time you use this power after each [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest), you don’t expend the Psionic Energy Die. All other times you use the power, you expend the die.

##### [](#Level3PsychicBlades)Level 3: Psychic Blades

You can manifest shimmering blades of psychic energy. Whenever you take the [Attack](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#AttackAction) action or make an [Opportunity Attack](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#OpportunityAttack), you can manifest a Psychic Blade in your free hand and make the attack with that blade. The magic blade has the following traits:

**Weapon Category:** Simple Melee

**Damage on a Hit:** 1d6 Psychic plus the ability modifier used for the attack roll

**Properties:** [Finesse](/sources/dnd/free-rules/equipment#Finesse), [Thrown](/sources/dnd/free-rules/equipment#Thrown) (range 60/120 feet)

**Mastery:** [Vex](/sources/dnd/free-rules/equipment#Vex) (you can use this property, and it doesn’t count against the number of properties you can use with [Weapon Mastery](/sources/dnd/phb-2024/equipment#MasteryProperties))

The blade vanishes immediately after it hits or misses its target, and it leaves no mark if it deals damage.

After you attack with the blade on your turn, you can make a melee or ranged attack with a second psychic blade as a Bonus Action on the same turn if your other hand is free to create it. The damage die of this bonus attack is 1d4 instead of 1d6.

##### [](#Level9SoulBlades)Level 9: Soul Blades

You can now use the following powers with your Psychic Blades.

**_Homing Strikes._** If you make an attack roll with your Psychic Blade and miss the target, you can roll one Psionic Energy Die and add the number rolled to the attack roll. If this causes the attack to hit, the die is expended.

**_Psychic Teleportation._** As a Bonus Action, you manifest a Psychic Blade, expend one Psionic Energy Die and roll it, and throw the blade at an unoccupied space you can see up to a number of feet away equal to 10 times the number rolled. You then teleport to that space, and the blade vanishes.

##### [](#Level13PsychicVeil)Level 13: Psychic Veil

You can weave a veil of psychic static to mask yourself. As a [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action, you gain the [Invisible](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#InvisibleCondition) condition for 1 hour or until you dismiss this effect (no action required). This invisibility ends early immediately after you deal damage to a creature or you force a creature to make a saving throw.

Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest) unless you expend a Psionic Energy Die (no action required) to restore your use of it.

##### [](#Level17RendMind)Level 17: Rend Mind

You can sweep your Psychic Blades through a creature’s mind. When you use your Psychic Blades to deal Sneak Attack damage to a creature, you can force that target to make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 8 plus your Dexterity modifier and Proficiency Bonus). If the save fails, the target has the [Stunned](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#StunnedCondition) condition for 1 minute. The Stunned target repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest) unless you expend three Psionic Energy Dice (no action required) to restore your use of it.

#### [](#Thief)Thief

_Hunt for Treasure as a Classic Adventurer_

A mix of burglar, treasure hunter, and explorer, you are the epitome of an adventurer. In addition to improving your agility and stealth, you gain abilities useful for delving into ruins and getting maximum benefit from the magic items you find there.

Thief Subclass

##### [](#Level3FastHands)Level 3: Fast Hands

As a Bonus Action, you can do one of the following.

**_Sleight of Hand._** Make a Dexterity ([Sleight of Hand](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check to pick a lock or disarm a trap with Thieves’ Tools or to pick a pocket.

**_Use an Object._** Take the [Utilize](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UtilizeAction) action, or take the [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action to use a magic item that requires that action.

##### [](#Level3SecondStoryWork)Level 3: Second-Story Work

You’ve trained to get into especially hard-to-reach places, granting you these benefits.

**_Climber._** You gain a Climb Speed equal to your Speed.

**_Jumper._** You can determine your jump distance using your Dexterity rather than your Strength.

##### [](#Level9SupremeSneak)Level 9: Supreme Sneak

You gain the following Cunning Strike option.

**_Stealth Attack (Cost: 1d6)._** If you have the [Hide](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#HideAction) action’s [Invisible](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#InvisibleCondition) condition, this attack doesn’t end that condition on you if you end the turn behind [Three-Quarters Cover](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Cover) or [Total Cover](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Cover).

##### [](#Level13UseMagicDevice)Level 13: Use Magic Device

You’ve learned how to maximize use of magic items, granting you the following benefits.

**_Attunement._** You can attune to up to four magic items at once.

**_Charges._** Whenever you use a magic item property that expends charges, roll 1d6. On a roll of 6, you use the property without expending the charges.

**_Scrolls._** You can use any [Spell Scroll](/magic-items/9229085-spell-scroll), using Intelligence as your spellcasting ability for the spell. If the spell is a cantrip or a level 1 spell, you can cast it reliably. If the scroll contains a higher-level spell, you must first succeed on an Intelligence ([Arcana](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check (DC 10 plus the spell’s level). On a successful check, you cast the spell from the scroll. On a failed check, the scroll disintegrates.

##### [](#Level17ThiefsReflexes)Level 17: Thief’s Reflexes

You are adept at laying ambushes and quickly escaping danger. You can take two turns during the first round of any combat. You take your first turn at your normal [Initiative](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Initiative) and your second turn at your Initiative minus 10.

Sorcerers wield innate magic that is stamped into their being. Some Sorcerers can’t name the origin of their power, while others trace it to strange events in their personal or family history. The blessing of a dragon or a dryad at a baby’s birth or the strike of lightning from a clear sky might spark a Sorcerer’s gift. So too might the gift of a deity, exposure to the strange magic of another plane of existence, or a glimpse into the inner workings of reality. Whatever the origin, the result is an indelible mark on the Sorcerer, a churning magic that can be passed down through generations.

Sorcerers don’t learn magic; the raw, roiling power of magic is part of them. The essential art of a Sorcerer is learning to harness and channel that innate magic, allowing the Sorcerer to discover new and staggering ways to unleash their power. As Sorcerers master their innate magic, they grow more attuned to its origin, developing distinct powers that reflect its source.

Sorcerers are rare. Some family lines produce exactly one Sorcerer in every generation, but most of the time, the talents of sorcery appear as a fluke. People who have this magical power soon discover that it doesn’t like to stay quiet. A Sorcerer’s magic wants to be wielded.

#### [](#Level1SorcererSpellcasting)Level 1: Spellcasting

Drawing from your innate magic, you can cast spells. See [chapter 7](/sources/dnd/phb-2024/spells/) for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Sorcerer spells, which appear in the [Sorcerer spell list](#SorcererSpellList) later in the class’s description.

**_Cantrips._** You know four Sorcerer cantrips of your choice. [Light](/spells/2618996-light), [Prestidigitation](/spells/2618893-prestidigitation), [Shocking Grasp](/spells/2618986-shocking-grasp), and [Sorcerous Burst](/spells/2618839-sorcerous-burst) are recommended. Whenever you gain a Sorcerer level, you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Sorcerer cantrip of your choice.

When you reach Sorcerer levels 4 and 10, you learn another Sorcerer cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the [Sorcerer Features table](#SorcererFeatures).

**_Spell Slots._** The Sorcerer Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

**_Prepared Spells of Level 1+._** You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Sorcerer spells. [Burning Hands](/spells/2618946-burning-hands) and [Detect Magic](/spells/2619097-detect-magic) are recommended.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Sorcerer levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the [Sorcerer Features table](#SorcererFeatures). Whenever that number increases, choose additional Sorcerer spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the Sorcerer Features table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 3 Sorcerer, your list of prepared spells can include six Sorcerer spells of level 1 or 2 in any combination.

If another Sorcerer feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Sorcerer spells for you.

**_Changing Your Prepared Spells._** Whenever you gain a Sorcerer level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Sorcerer spell for which you have spell slots.

**_Spellcasting Ability._** Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Sorcerer spells.

**_Spellcasting Focus._** You can use an [Arcane Focus](/equipment/544-arcane-focus) as a Spellcasting Focus for your Sorcerer spells.

#### [](#Level1InnateSorcery)Level 1: Innate Sorcery

An event in your past left an indelible mark on you, infusing you with simmering magic. As a Bonus Action, you can unleash that magic for 1 minute, during which you gain the following benefits:

*   The spell save DC of your Sorcerer spells increases by 1.
*   You have [Advantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Advantage) on the attack rolls of Sorcerer spells you cast.

You can use this feature twice, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

#### [](#Level2FontofMagic)Level 2: Font of Magic

You can tap into the wellspring of magic within yourself. This wellspring is represented by Sorcery Points, which allow you to create a variety of magical effects.

You have 2 Sorcery Points, and you gain more as you reach higher levels, as shown in the Sorcery Points column of the [Sorcerer Features table](#SorcererFeatures). You can’t have more Sorcery Points than the number shown in the table for your level. You regain all expended Sorcery Points when you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

You can use your Sorcery Points to fuel the options below, along with other features, such as Metamagic, that use those points.

**_Converting Spell Slots to Sorcery Points._** You can expend a spell slot to gain a number of Sorcery Points equal to the slot’s level (no action required).

**_Creating Spell Slots._** As a Bonus Action, you can transform unexpended Sorcery Points into one spell slot. The Creating Spell Slots table shows the cost of creating a spell slot of a given level, and it lists the minimum Sorcerer level you must be to create a slot. You can create a spell slot no higher than level 5.

Any spell slot you create with this feature vanishes when you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

#### [](#Level2Metamagic)Level 2: Metamagic

Because your magic flows from within, you can alter your spells to suit your needs; you gain two Metamagic options of your choice from “[Metamagic Options](#MetamagicOptions)” later in this class’s description. You use the chosen options to temporarily modify spells you cast. To use an option, you must spend the number of Sorcery Points that it costs.

You can use only one Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it unless otherwise noted in one of those options.

Whenever you gain a Sorcerer level, you can replace one of your Metamagic options with one you don’t know. You gain two more options at Sorcerer level 10 and two more at Sorcerer level 17.

#### [](#Level3SorcererSubclass)Level 3: Sorcerer Subclass

You gain a Sorcerer subclass of your choice. The [Aberrant Sorcery](#AberrantSorcery), [Clockwork Sorcery](#ClockworkSorcery), [Draconic Sorcery](#DraconicSorcery), and [Wild Magic Sorcery](#WildMagicSorcery) subclasses are detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Sorcerer levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Sorcerer level or lower.

#### [](#Level4SorcererAbilityScoreImprovement)Level 4: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see [chapter 5](/sources/dnd/phb-2024/feats#AbilityScoreImprovement)) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Sorcerer levels 8, 12, and 16.

#### [](#Level5SorcerousRestoration)Level 5: Sorcerous Restoration

When you finish a [Short Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest), you can regain expended Sorcery Points, but no more than a number equal to half your Sorcerer level (round down). Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

#### [](#Level7SorceryIncarnate)Level 7: Sorcery Incarnate

If you have no uses of Innate Sorcery left, you can use it if you spend 2 Sorcery Points when you take the Bonus Action to activate it.

In addition, while your Innate Sorcery feature is active, you can use up to two of your [Metamagic options](#MetamagicOptions) on each spell you cast.

#### [](#Level19SorcererEpicBoon)Level 19: Epic Boon

You gain an Epic Boon feat (see [chapter 5](/sources/dnd/phb-2024/feats#EpicBoonFeats)) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. [Boon of Dimensional Travel](/sources/dnd/phb-2024/feats#BoonofDimensionalTravel) is recommended.

#### [](#Level20ArcaneApotheosis)Level 20: Arcane Apotheosis

While your Innate Sorcery feature is active, you can use one Metamagic option on each of your turns without spending Sorcery Points on it.

##### [](#QuickenedSpell)Quickened Spell

_Cost: 2 Sorcery Points_

When you cast a spell that has a casting time of an action, you can spend 2 Sorcery Points to change the casting time to a Bonus Action for this casting.

##### [](#SeekingSpell)Seeking Spell

_Cost: 1 Sorcery Point_

If you make an attack roll for a spell and miss, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to reroll the d20, and you must use the new roll.

##### [](#SubtleSpell)Subtle Spell

_Cost: 1 Sorcery Point_

### [](#SorcererSpellList)Sorcerer Spell List

### [](#SorcererSubclasses)Sorcerer Subclasses

A Sorcerer subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Sorcerer levels, as specified in the subclass. This section presents the [Aberrant Sorcery](#AberrantSorcery), [Clockwork Sorcery](#ClockworkSorcery), [Draconic Sorcery](#DraconicSorcery), and [Wild Magic Sorcery](#WildMagicSorcery) subclasses.

#### [](#AberrantSorcery)Aberrant Sorcery

_Wield Unnatural Psionic Power_

An alien influence has wrapped its tendrils around your mind, giving you psionic power. You can now touch other minds with that power and alter the world around you. Will this power shine from you as a hopeful beacon to others? Or will you be a terror to those who feel the stab of your mind?

Perhaps a psychic wind from the Astral Plane carried psionic energy to you, or you were exposed to the Far Realm’s warping influence. Alternatively, you were implanted with a mind flayer tadpole, but your transformation into a mind flayer never occurred; now the tadpole’s psionic power is yours. However you acquired this power, your mind is aflame with it.

##### [](#Level3PsionicSpells)Level 3: Psionic Spells

When you reach a Sorcerer level specified in the Psionic Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

Aberrant Sorcery Subclass

##### [](#Level3TelepathicSpeech)Level 3: Telepathic Speech

You can form a telepathic connection between your mind and the mind of another. As a Bonus Action, choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself. You and the chosen creature can communicate telepathically with each other while the two of you are within a number of miles of each other equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1 mile). To understand each other, you each must mentally use a language the other knows.

The telepathic connection lasts for a number of minutes equal to your Sorcerer level. It ends early if you use this ability to form a connection with a different creature.

##### [](#Level6PsionicSorcery)Level 6: Psionic Sorcery

When you cast any level 1+ spell from your Psionic Spells feature, you can cast it by expending a spell slot as normal or by spending a number of Sorcery Points equal to the spell’s level. If you cast the spell using Sorcery Points, it requires no Verbal or Somatic components, and it requires no Material components unless they are consumed by the spell or have a cost specified in it.

##### [](#Level6PsychicDefenses)Level 6: Psychic Defenses

You have Resistance to Psychic damage, and you have [Advantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Advantage) on saving throws to avoid or end the [Charmed](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CharmedCondition) or [Frightened](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition) condition.

##### [](#Level14RevelationinFlesh)Level 14: Revelation in Flesh

You can unleash the aberrant truth hidden within yourself. As a Bonus Action, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point or more to magically alter your body for 10 minutes. For each Sorcery Point you spend, you gain one of the following benefits of your choice, the effects of which last until the alteration ends.

**_Aquatic Adaptation._** You gain a Swim Speed equal to twice your Speed, and you can breathe underwater. Gills grow from your neck or flare behind your ears, and your fingers become webbed or you grow wriggling cilia.

**_Glistening Flight._** You gain a Fly Speed equal to your Speed, and you can hover. As you fly, your skin glistens with mucus or otherworldly light.

**_See the Invisible._** You can see any [Invisible](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#InvisibleCondition) creature within 60 feet of yourself that isn’t behind [Total Cover](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Cover). Your eyes also turn black or become writhing sensory tendrils.

**_Wormlike Movement._** Your body, along with any equipment you are wearing or carrying, becomes slimy and pliable. You can move through any space as narrow as 1 inch, and you can spend 5 feet of movement to escape from nonmagical restraints or the [Grappled](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#GrappledCondition) condition.

##### [](#Level18WarpingImplosion)Level 18: Warping Implosion

You can unleash a space-warping anomaly. As a [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action, you teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within 120 feet of yourself. Immediately after you disappear, each creature within 30 feet of the space you left must make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, a creature takes 3d10 Force damage and is pulled straight toward the space you left, ending in an unoccupied space as close to your former space as possible. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage only.

Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest) unless you spend 5 Sorcery Points (no action required) to restore your use of it.

#### [](#ClockworkSorcery)Clockwork Sorcery

_Channel Cosmic Forces of Order_

The cosmic force of order has suffused you with magic. That power arises from Mechanus or a realm like it—a plane of existence shaped entirely by clockwork efficiency. You or someone from your lineage might have become entangled in the machinations of modrons, the orderly beings who inhabit Mechanus. Perhaps your ancestor even took part in the Great Modron March. Whatever its origin within you, the power of order can seem strange to others, but for you, it’s part of a vast and glorious system.

##### [](#Level3ClockworkSpells)Level 3: Clockwork Spells

When you reach a Sorcerer level specified in the Clockwork Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

|     |     |

##### [](#ClockworkSpells)Clockwork Spells

In addition, consult the Manifestations of Order table and choose or randomly determine a way your connection to order manifests while you are casting any of your Sorcerer spells.

| 5   | Your Spellcasting Focus temporarily takes the form of a Tiny clockwork mechanism. |
| 6   | The ticking of gears or ringing of a clock can be heard by you and those affected by your magic. |

##### [](#Level3RestoreBalance)Level 3: Restore Balance

Your connection to the plane of absolute order allows you to equalize chaotic moments. When a creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself is about to roll a d20 with [Advantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Advantage) or [Disadvantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Disadvantage), you can take a Reaction to prevent the roll from being affected by Advantage and Disadvantage.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

##### [](#Level6BastionofLaw)Level 6: Bastion of Law

You can tap into the grand equation of existence to imbue a creature with a shimmering shield of order. As a [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action, you can expend 1 to 5 Sorcery Points to create a magical ward around yourself or another creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself. The ward is represented by a number of d8s equal to the number of Sorcery Points spent to create it. When the warded creature takes damage, it can expend a number of those dice, roll them, and reduce the damage taken by the total rolled on those dice.

The ward lasts until you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest) or until you use this feature again.

##### [](#Level14TranceofOrder)Level 14: Trance of Order

You gain the ability to align your consciousness with the endless calculations of Mechanus. As a Bonus Action, you can enter this state for 1 minute. For the duration, attack rolls against you can’t benefit from [Advantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Advantage), and whenever you make a [D20 Test](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#D20Test), you can treat a roll of 9 or lower on the d20 as a 10.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest) unless you spend 5 Sorcery Points (no action required) to restore your use of it.

##### [](#Level18ClockworkCavalcade)Level 18: Clockwork Cavalcade

You momentarily summon spirits of order to expunge disorder around you. As a [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action, you summon the spirits in a 30-foot [Cube](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CubeAreaofEffect) originating from you. The spirits look like modrons or other Constructs of your choice. The spirits are intangible and invulnerable, and they create the effects below within the Cube before vanishing. Once you use this action, you can’t use it again until you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest) unless you spend 7 Sorcery Points (no action required) to restore your use of it.

**_Heal._** The spirits restore up to 100 Hit Points, divided as you choose among any number of creatures of your choice in the Cube.

**_Repair._** Any damaged objects entirely in the Cube are repaired instantly.

**_Dispel._** Every spell of level 6 and lower ends on creatures and objects of your choice in the Cube.

#### [](#DraconicSorcery)Draconic Sorcery

_Breathe the Magic of Dragons_

Your innate magic comes from the gift of a dragon. Perhaps an ancient dragon facing death bequeathed some of its magical power to you or your ancestor. You might have absorbed magic from a site infused with dragons’ power. Or perhaps you handled a treasure taken from a dragon’s hoard that was steeped in draconic power. Or you might have a dragon for an ancestor.

Draconic Sorcery Subclass

##### [](#Level3DraconicResilience)Level 3: Draconic Resilience

The magic in your body manifests physical traits of your draconic gift. Your Hit Point maximum increases by 3, and it increases by 1 whenever you gain another Sorcerer level.

Parts of you are also covered by dragon-like scales. While you aren’t wearing armor, your base Armor Class equals 10 plus your Dexterity and Charisma modifiers.

##### [](#Level3DraconicSpells)Level 3: Draconic Spells

When you reach a Sorcerer level specified in the Draconic Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
##### [](#DraconicSpells)Draconic Spells

| 9   | [Legend Lore](/spells/2619010-legend-lore), [Summon Dragon](/spells/2618843-summon-dragon) |

##### [](#Level6ElementalAffinity)Level 6: Elemental Affinity

Your draconic magic has an affinity with a damage type associated with dragons. Choose one of those types: Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Poison.

You have Resistance to that damage type, and when you cast a spell that deals damage of that type, you can add your Charisma modifier to one damage roll of that spell.

##### [](#Level14DragonWings)Level 14: Dragon Wings

As a Bonus Action, you can cause draconic wings to appear on your back. The wings last for 1 hour or until you dismiss them (no action required). For the duration, you have a Fly Speed of 60 feet.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest) unless you spend 3 Sorcery Points (no action required) to restore your use of it.

##### [](#Level18DragonCompanion)Level 18: Dragon Companion

You can cast [Summon Dragon](/spells/2618843-summon-dragon) without a Material component. You can also cast it once without a spell slot, and you regain the ability to cast it in this way when you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

Whenever you start casting the spell, you can modify it so that it doesn’t require [Concentration](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration). If you do so, the spell’s duration becomes 1 minute for that casting.

#### [](#WildMagicSorcery)Wild Magic Sorcery

_Unleash Chaotic Magic_

Your innate magic stems from the forces of chaos that underlie the order of creation. You or an ancestor might have endured exposure to raw magic, perhaps through a planar portal leading to Limbo or the Elemental Planes. Perhaps you were blessed by a fey being or marked by a demon. Or your magic could be a fluke with no apparent cause. Whatever its source, this magic churns within you, waiting for any outlet.

##### [](#Level3WildMagicSurge)Level 3: Wild Magic Surge

Your spellcasting can unleash surges of untamed magic. Once per turn, you can roll 1d20 immediately after you cast a Sorcerer spell with a spell slot. If you roll a 20, roll on the [Wild Magic Surge table](#WildMagicSurge) to create a magical effect.

If the magical effect is a spell, it is too wild to be affected by your Metamagic.

##### [](#Level3TidesofChaos)Level 3: Tides of Chaos

You can manipulate chaos itself to give yourself [Advantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Advantage) on one [D20 Test](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#D20Test) before you roll the d20. Once you do so, you must cast a Sorcerer spell with a spell slot or finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest) before you can use this feature again.

If you do cast a Sorcerer spell with a spell slot before you finish a Long Rest, you automatically roll on the [Wild Magic Surge table](#WildMagicSurge).

##### [](#Level6BendLuck)Level 6: Bend Luck

You have the ability to twist fate using your wild magic. Immediately after another creature you can see rolls the d20 for a [D20 Test](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#D20Test), you can take a Reaction and spend 1 Sorcery Point to roll 1d4 and apply the number rolled as a bonus or penalty (your choice) to the d20 roll.

##### [](#Level14ControlledChaos)Level 14: Controlled Chaos

You gain a modicum of control over the surges of your wild magic. Whenever you roll on the [Wild Magic Surge table](#WildMagicSurge), you can roll twice and use either number.

The Sorcerer Delina manipulates wild magic to create unpredictable wonders

##### [](#Level18TamedSurge)Level 18: Tamed Surge

Immediately after you cast a Sorcerer spell with a spell slot, you can create an effect of your choice from the Wild Magic Surge table instead of rolling on that table. You can choose any effect in the table except for the final row, and if the chosen effect involves a roll, you must make it.

Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

If the spell normally requires [Concentration](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration), it doesn’t require Concentration in this case; the spell lasts for its full duration. Roll 1d10 to determine the spell: on a **1**, [Confusion](/spells/2619043-confusion); on a **2**, [Fireball](/spells/2618887-fireball); on a **3**, [Fog Cloud](/spells/2618910-fog-cloud); on a **4**, [Fly](/spells/2618909-fly) (cast on a random creature within 60 feet of you), on a **5**, [Grease](/spells/2618957-grease); on a **6**, [Levitate](/spells/2618994-levitate) (cast on yourself); on a **7**, [Magic Missile](/spells/2619022-magic-missile) (cast as a level 5 spell); on an **8**, [Mirror Image](/spells/2619060-mirror-image); on a **9**, [Polymorph](/spells/2618876-polymorph) (cast on yourself), and if you fail the saving throw, you turn into a [Goat](/monsters/4775823-goat) (see [appendix B](/sources/dnd/phb-2024/creature-stat-blocks#Goat)); on a **10**, [See Invisibility](/spells/2619011-see-invisibility). |

Warlocks quest for knowledge that lies hidden in the fabric of the multiverse. They often begin their search for magical power by delving into tomes of forbidden lore, dabbling in invocations meant to attract the power of extraplanar beings, or seeking places of power where the influence of these beings can be felt. In no time, each Warlock is drawn into a binding pact with a powerful patron. Drawing on the ancient knowledge of beings such as angels, archfey, demons, devils, hags, and alien entities of the Far Realm, Warlocks piece together arcane secrets to bolster their own power.

Warlocks view their patrons as resources, as means to the end of achieving magical power. Some Warlocks respect, revere, or even love their patrons; some serve their patrons grudgingly; and some seek to undermine their patrons even as they wield the power their patrons have given them.

Once a pact is made, a Warlock’s thirst for knowledge and power can’t be slaked with mere study. Most Warlocks spend their days pursuing greater power and deeper knowledge, which typically means some kind of adventure.

#### [](#Level1EldritchInvocations)Level 1: Eldritch Invocations

You have unearthed Eldritch Invocations, pieces of forbidden knowledge that imbue you with an abiding magical ability or other lessons. You gain one invocation of your choice, such as [Pact of the Tome](#PactoftheTome). Invocations are described in the “[Eldritch Invocation Options](#EldritchInvocationOptions)” section later in this class’s description.

**_Prerequisites._** If an invocation has a prerequisite, you must meet it to learn that invocation. For example, if an invocation requires you to be a level 5+ Warlock, you can select the invocation once you reach Warlock level 5.

**_Replacing and Gaining Invocations._** Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one of your invocations with another one for which you qualify. You can’t replace an invocation if it’s a prerequisite for another invocation that you have.

When you gain certain Warlock levels, you gain more invocations of your choice, as shown in the Invocations column of the [Warlock Features table](#WarlockFeatures).

You can’t pick the same invocation more than once unless its description says otherwise.

#### [](#Level1PactMagic)Level 1: Pact Magic

Through occult ceremony, you have formed a pact with a mysterious entity to gain magical powers. The entity is a voice in the shadows—its identity unclear—but its boon to you is concrete: the ability to cast spells. See [chapter 7](/sources/dnd/phb-2024/spells/) for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Warlock spells, which appear in the [Warlock spell list](#WarlockSpellList) later in the class’s description.

**_Cantrips._** You know two Warlock cantrips of your choice. [Eldritch Blast](/spells/2619161-eldritch-blast) and [Prestidigitation](/spells/2618893-prestidigitation) are recommended. Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Warlock cantrip of your choice.

When you reach Warlock levels 4 and 10, you learn another Warlock cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the [Warlock Features table](#WarlockFeatures).

**_Spell Slots._** The Warlock Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your Warlock spells of levels 1–5. The table also shows the level of those slots, all of which are the same level. You regain all expended Pact Magic spell slots when you finish a [Short](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest) or [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

For example, when you’re a level 5 Warlock, you have two level 3 spell slots. To cast the level 1 spell [Witch Bolt](/spells/2619215-witch-bolt), you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a level 3 spell.

**_Prepared Spells of Level 1+._** You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Warlock spells. [Charm Person](/spells/2618964-charm-person) and [Hex](/spells/2618988-hex) are recommended.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Warlock levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the [Warlock Features table](#WarlockFeatures). Whenever that number increases, choose additional Warlock spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the table. The chosen spells must be of a level no higher than what’s shown in the table’s Slot Level column for your level. When you reach level 6, for example, you learn a new Warlock spell, which can be of levels 1–3.

If another Warlock feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Warlock spells for you.

**_Changing Your Prepared Spells._** Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Warlock spell of an eligible level.

**_Spellcasting Ability._** Charisma is the spellcasting ability for your Warlock spells.

**_Spellcasting Focus._** You can use an [Arcane Focus](/equipment/544-arcane-focus) as a Spellcasting Focus for your Warlock spells.

#### [](#Level2MagicalCunning)Level 2: Magical Cunning

You can perform an esoteric rite for 1 minute. At the end of it, you regain expended Pact Magic spell slots but no more than a number equal to half your maximum (round up). Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

#### [](#Level3WarlockSubclass)Level 3: Warlock Subclass

You gain a Warlock subclass of your choice. The [Archfey Patron](#ArchfeyPatron), [Celestial Patron](#CelestialPatron), [Fiend Patron](#FiendPatron), and [Great Old One Patron](#GreatOldOnePatron) subclasses are detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Warlock levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Warlock level or lower.

#### [](#Level4WarlockAbilityScoreImprovement)Level 4: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see [chapter 5](/sources/dnd/phb-2024/feats#AbilityScoreImprovement)) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Warlock levels 8, 12, and 16.

#### [](#Level9ContactPatron)Level 9: Contact Patron

In the past, you usually contacted your patron through intermediaries. Now you can communicate directly; you always have the [Contact Other Plane](/spells/2619052-contact-other-plane) spell prepared. With this feature, you can cast the spell without expending a spell slot to contact your patron, and you automatically succeed on the spell’s saving throw.

Once you cast the spell with this feature, you can’t do so in this way again until you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

#### [](#Level11MysticArcanum)Level 11: Mystic Arcanum

Your patron grants you a magical secret called an arcanum. Choose one level 6 Warlock spell as this arcanum.

You can cast your arcanum spell once without expending a spell slot, and you must finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest) before you can cast it in this way again.

As shown in the [Warlock Features table](#WarlockFeatures), you gain another Warlock spell of your choice that can be cast in this way when you reach Warlock levels 13 (level 7 spell), 15 (level 8 spell), and 17 (level 9 spell). You regain all uses of your Mystic Arcanum when you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

WAYNE ENGLAND [![](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/phb/MKDHZ1nxSXDDLOw2/04-029.skull-spiders.png)](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/phb/MKDHZ1nxSXDDLOw2/04-029.skull-spiders.png)

Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one of your arcanum spells with another Warlock spell of the same level.

#### [](#Level19WarlockEpicBoon)Level 19: Epic Boon

You gain an Epic Boon feat (see [chapter 5](/sources/dnd/phb-2024/feats#EpicBoonFeats)) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. [Boon of Fate](/sources/dnd/phb-2024/feats#BoonofFate) is recommended.

_Prerequisite: Level 5+ Warlock_

You can use a Bonus Action to touch a willing creature and perceive through its senses until the end of your next turn.

The connection ends if you don’t maintain it in this way.

When any creature whose name is on the page is reduced to 0 Hit Points but not killed outright, the creature magically drops to 1 Hit Point instead. Once this magic is triggered, no creature can benefit from it until you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

Whenever you attack with the bonded weapon, you can use your Charisma modifier for the attack and damage rolls instead of using Strength or Dexterity; and you can cause the weapon to deal Necrotic, Psychic, or Radiant damage or its normal damage type.

### [](#WarlockSubclasses)Warlock Subclasses

A Warlock subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Warlock levels, as specified in the subclass. This section presents the [Archfey Patron](#ArchfeyPatron), [Celestial Patron](#CelestialPatron), [Fiend Patron](#FiendPatron), and [Great Old One Patron](#GreatOldOnePatron) subclasses.

#### [](#ArchfeyPatron)Archfey Patron

_Bargain with Whimsical Fey_

Your pact draws on the power of the Feywild. When you choose this subclass, you might make a deal with an archfey, such as the Prince of Frost; the Queen of Air and Darkness, ruler of the Gloaming Court; Titania of the Summer Court; or an ancient hag. Or you might call on a spectrum of Fey, weaving a web of favors and debts. Whoever they are, your patron is often inscrutable and whimsical.

##### [](#Level3StepsoftheFey)Level 3: Steps of the Fey

Your patron grants you the ability to move between the boundaries of the planes. You can cast [Misty Step](/spells/2619133-misty-step) without expending a spell slot a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

In addition, whenever you cast that spell, you can choose one of the following additional effects.

**_Refreshing Step._** Immediately after you teleport, you or one creature you can see within 10 feet of yourself gains 1d10 [Temporary Hit Points](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#TemporaryHitPoints).

**_Taunting Step._** Creatures within 5 feet of the space you left must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or have [Disadvantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Disadvantage) on attack rolls against creatures other than you until the start of your next turn.

##### [](#Level6MistyEscape)Level 6: Misty Escape

**_Dreadful Step._** Creatures within 5 feet of the space you left or the space you appear in (your choice) must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or take 2d10 Psychic damage.

##### [](#Level10BeguilingDefenses)Level 10: Beguiling Defenses

Your patron teaches you how to guard your mind and body. You are immune to the [Charmed](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CharmedCondition) condition.

In addition, immediately after a creature you can see hits you with an attack roll, you can take a Reaction to reduce the damage you take by half (round down), and you can force the attacker to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the attacker takes Psychic damage equal to the damage you take. Once you use this Reaction, you can’t use it again until you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest) unless you expend a Pact Magic spell slot (no action required) to restore your use of it.

##### [](#Level14BewitchingMagic)Level 14: Bewitching Magic

Your patron grants you the ability to weave your magic with teleportation. Immediately after you cast an Enchantment or Illusion spell using an action and a spell slot, you can cast [Misty Step](/spells/2619133-misty-step) as part of the same action and without expending a spell slot.

#### [](#CelestialPatron)Celestial Patron

_Call on the Power of the Heavens_

Your pact draws on the Upper Planes, the realms of everlasting bliss. You might enter an agreement with an empyrean, a couatl, a sphinx, a unicorn, or another heavenly entity.

##### [](#Level3CelestialSpells)Level 3: Celestial Spells

As a Bonus Action, you can heal yourself or one creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself, expending dice from the pool. The maximum number of dice you can expend at once equals your Charisma modifier (minimum of one die). Roll the dice you expend, and restore a number of Hit Points equal to the roll’s total. Your pool regains all expended dice when you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

Celestial Patron Subclass

##### [](#Level6RadiantSoul)Level 6: Radiant Soul

Your link to your patron allows you to serve as a conduit for radiant energy. You have Resistance to Radiant damage. Once per turn, when a spell you cast deals Radiant or Fire damage, you can add your Charisma modifier to that spell’s damage against one of the spell’s targets.

##### [](#Level10CelestialResilience)Level 10: Celestial Resilience

You gain [Temporary Hit Points](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#TemporaryHitPoints) whenever you use your Magical Cunning feature or finish a [Short](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest) or [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

Those creatures each gain Temporary Hit Points equal to half your Warlock level plus your Charisma modifier.

##### [](#Level14SearingVengeance)Level 14: Searing Vengeance

When you or an ally within 60 feet of you is about to make a [Death Saving Throw](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DeathSavingThrow), you can unleash radiant energy to save the creature. The creature regains Hit Points equal to half its Hit Point maximum and can end the [Prone](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ProneCondition) condition on itself. Each creature of your choice that is within 30 feet of the creature takes Radiant damage equal to 2d8 plus your Charisma modifier, and each has the [Blinded](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BlindedCondition) condition until the end of the current turn.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

#### [](#FiendPatron)Fiend Patron

_Make a Deal with the Lower Planes_

Your pact draws on the Lower Planes, the realms of perdition. You might forge a bargain with a demon lord such as Demogorgon or Orcus; an archdevil such as Asmodeus; or a pit fiend, balor, yugoloth, or night hag that is especially mighty. That patron’s aims are evil—the corruption or destruction of all things, ultimately including you—and your path is defined by the extent to which you strive against those aims.

##### [](#Level6DarkOnesOwnLuck)Level 6: Dark One’s Own Luck

You can call on your fiendish patron to alter fate in your favor. When you make an ability check or a saving throw, you can use this feature to add 1d10 to your roll. You can do so after seeing the roll but before any of the roll’s effects occur.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), but you can use it no more than once per roll. You regain all expended uses when you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

##### [](#Level14HurlThroughHell)Level 14: Hurl Through Hell

Once per turn when you hit a creature with an attack roll, you can try to instantly transport the target through the Lower Planes. The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC, or the target disappears and hurtles through a nightmare landscape. The target takes 8d10 Psychic damage if it isn’t a Fiend, and it has the [Incapacitated](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition until the end of your next turn, when it returns to the space it previously occupied or the nearest unoccupied space.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest) unless you expend a Pact Magic spell slot (no action required) to restore your use of it.

#### [](#GreatOldOnePatron)Great Old One Patron

_Unearth Forbidden Lore of Ineffable Beings_

When you choose this subclass, you might bind yourself to an unspeakable being from the Far Realm or an elder god—a being such as Tharizdun, the Chained God; Zargon, the Returner; Hadar, the Dark Hunger; or Great Cthulhu. Or you might invoke several entities without yoking yourself to one. The motives of these beings are incomprehensible, and the Great Old One might be indifferent to your existence. But the secrets you’ve learned nevertheless allow you to draw strange magic from it.

##### [](#Level3AwakenedMind)Level 3: Awakened Mind

You can form a telepathic connection between your mind and the mind of another. As a Bonus Action, choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself. You and the chosen creature can communicate telepathically with each other while the two of you are within a number of miles of each other equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1 mile). To understand each other, you each must mentally use a language the other knows.

The telepathic connection lasts for a number of minutes equal to your Warlock level. It ends early if you use this feature to connect with a different creature.

##### [](#Level3GreatOldOneSpells)Level 3: Great Old One Spells

The magic of your patron ensures you always have certain spells ready; when you reach a Warlock level specified in the Great Old One Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

On a failed save, the creature has [Disadvantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Disadvantage) on attack rolls against you, and you have [Advantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Advantage) on attack rolls against that creature for the duration of the bond.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a [Short](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest) or [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest) unless you expend a Pact Magic spell slot (no action required) to restore your use of it.

##### [](#Level10EldritchHex)Level 10: Eldritch Hex

Your alien patron grants you a powerful curse. You always have the [Hex](/spells/2618988-hex) spell prepared. When you cast _Hex_ and choose an ability, the target also has [Disadvantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Disadvantage) on saving throws of the chosen ability for the duration of the spell.

##### [](#Level10ThoughtShield)Level 10: Thought Shield

Your thoughts can’t be read by telepathy or other means unless you allow it. You also have Resistance to Psychic damage, and whenever a creature deals Psychic damage to you, that creature takes the same amount of damage that you take.

##### [](#Level14CreateThrall)Level 14: Create Thrall

When you cast [Summon Aberration](/spells/2619105-summon-aberration), you can modify it so that it doesn’t require [Concentration](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration). If you do so, the spell’s duration becomes 1 minute for that casting, and when summoned, the Aberration has a number of [Temporary Hit Points](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#TemporaryHitPoints) equal to your Warlock level plus your Charisma modifier.

In addition, the first time each turn the Aberration hits a creature under the effect of your [Hex](/spells/2618988-hex), the Aberration deals extra Psychic damage to the target equal to the bonus damage of that spell.

Wizards are defined by their exhaustive study of magic’s inner workings. They cast spells of explosive fire, arcing lightning, subtle deception, and spectacular transformations. Their magic conjures monsters from other planes of existence, glimpses the future, or forms protective barriers. Their mightiest spells change one substance into another, call meteors from the sky, or open portals to other worlds.

Most Wizards share a scholarly approach to magic. They examine the theoretical underpinnings of magic, particularly the categorization of spells into schools of magic. Renowned Wizards such as Bigby, Tasha, Mordenkainen, and Yolande have built on their studies to invent iconic spells now used across the multiverse.

The closest a Wizard is likely to come to an ordinary life is working as a sage or lecturer. Other Wizards sell their services as advisers, serve in military forces, or pursue lives of crime or domination.

But the lure of knowledge calls even the most unadventurous Wizards from the safety of their libraries and laboratories and into crumbling ruins and lost cities. Most Wizards believe that their counterparts in ancient civilizations knew secrets of magic that have been lost to the ages, and discovering those secrets could unlock the path to a power greater than any magic available in the present age.

#### [](#Level1WizardSpellcasting)Level 1: Spellcasting

As a student of arcane magic, you have learned to cast spells. See [chapter 7](/sources/dnd/phb-2024/spells/) for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Wizard spells, which appear in the Wizard spell list later in the class’s description.

**_Cantrips._** You know three Wizard cantrips of your choice. [Light](/spells/2618996-light), [Mage Hand](/spells/2619008-mage-hand), and [Ray of Frost](/spells/2618930-ray-of-frost) are recommended. Whenever you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest), you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Wizard cantrip of your choice.

When you reach Wizard levels 4 and 10, you learn another Wizard cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the [Wizard Features table](#WizardFeatures).

**_Spellbook._** Your wizardly apprenticeship culminated in the creation of a unique book: your spellbook. It is a Tiny object that weighs 3 pounds, contains 100 pages, and can be read only by you or someone casting [Identify](/spells/2619180-identify). You determine the book’s appearance and materials, such as a gilt-edged tome or a collection of vellum bound with twine.

The book contains the level 1+ spells you know. It starts with six level 1 Wizard spells of your choice. [Detect Magic](/spells/2619097-detect-magic), [Feather Fall](/spells/2618874-feather-fall), [Mage Armor](/spells/2619006-mage-armor), [Magic Missile](/spells/2619022-magic-missile), [Sleep](/spells/2619064-sleep), and [Thunderwave](/spells/2619184-thunderwave) are recommended.

Whenever you gain a Wizard level after 1, add two Wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown in the [Wizard Features table](#WizardFeatures). The spells are the culmination of arcane research you do regularly.

**_Spell Slots._** The Wizard Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

**_Prepared Spells of Level 1+._** You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To do so, choose four spells from your spellbook. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Wizard levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the [Wizard Features table](#WizardFeatures). Whenever that number increases, choose additional Wizard spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 3 Wizard, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination, chosen from your spellbook.

If another Wizard feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Wizard spells for you.

**_Changing Your Prepared Spells._** Whenever you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest), you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells there with spells from your spellbook.

**_Spellcasting Ability._** Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Wizard spells.

**_Spellcasting Focus._** You can use an [Arcane Focus](/equipment/544-arcane-focus) or your [spellbook](/equipment/86-spellbook) as a Spellcasting Focus for your Wizard spells.

Expanding and Replacing a Spellbook

The spells you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect your ongoing magical research, but you might find other spells during your adventures that you can add to the book. You could discover a Wizard spell on a [Spell Scroll](/magic-items/9229085-spell-scroll), for example, and then copy it into your spellbook.

**_Copying a Spell into the Book._** When you find a level 1+ Wizard spell, you can copy it into your spellbook if it’s of a level you can prepare and if you have time to copy it. For each level of the spell, the transcription takes 2 hours and costs 50 GP. Afterward you can prepare the spell like the other spells in your spellbook.

**_Copying the Book._** You can copy a spell from your spellbook into another book. This is like copying a new spell into your spellbook but faster, since you already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 GP for each level of the copied spell.

If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the Wizard spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of the new book requires you to find new spells to do so. For this reason, many wizards keep a backup spellbook.

#### [](#Level1RitualAdept)Level 1: Ritual Adept

You can cast any spell as a Ritual if that spell has the Ritual tag and the spell is in your spellbook. You needn’t have the spell prepared, but you must read from the book to cast a spell in this way.

#### [](#Level1ArcaneRecovery)Level 1: Arcane Recovery

You can regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. When you finish a [Short Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest), you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level equal to no more than half your Wizard level (round up), and none of the slots can be level 6 or higher. For example, if you’re a level 4 Wizard, you can recover up to two levels’ worth of spell slots, regaining either one level 2 spell slot or two level 1 spell slots.

Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

#### [](#Level2Scholar)Level 2: Scholar

While studying magic, you also specialized in another field of study. Choose one of the following skills in which you have proficiency: [Arcana](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills), [History](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills), [Investigation](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills), [Medicine](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills), [Nature](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills), or [Religion](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills). You have [Expertise](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Expertise) in the chosen skill.

#### [](#Level3WizardSubclass)Level 3: Wizard Subclass

You gain a Wizard subclass of your choice. The [Abjurer](#Abjurer), [Diviner](#Diviner), [Evoker](#Evoker), and [Illusionist](#Illusionist) subclasses are detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Wizard levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Wizard level or lower.

#### [](#Level4WizardAbilityScoreImprovement)Level 4: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see [chapter 5](/sources/dnd/phb-2024/feats#AbilityScoreImprovement)) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Wizard levels 8, 12, and 16.

#### [](#Level5MemorizeSpell)Level 5: Memorize Spell

Whenever you finish a [Short Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest), you can study your spellbook and replace one of the level 1+ Wizard spells you have prepared for your Spellcasting feature with another level 1+ spell from the book.

#### [](#Level18SpellMastery)Level 18: Spell Mastery

You have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you can cast them at will. Choose a level 1 and a level 2 spell in your spellbook that have a casting time of an action. You always have those spells prepared, and you can cast them at their lowest level without expending a spell slot. To cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot.

Whenever you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest), you can study your spellbook and replace one of those spells with an eligible spell of the same level from the book.

#### [](#Level19WizardEpicBoon)Level 19: Epic Boon

You gain an Epic Boon feat (see [chapter 5](/sources/dnd/phb-2024/feats#EpicBoonFeats)) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. [Boon of Spell Recall](/sources/dnd/phb-2024/feats#BoonofSpellRecall) is recommended.

#### [](#Level20SignatureSpells)Level 20: Signature Spells

Choose two level 3 spells in your spellbook as your signature spells. You always have these spells prepared, and you can cast each of them once at level 3 without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can’t cast them in this way again until you finish a [Short](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest) or [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest). To cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot.

### [](#WizardSpellList)Wizard Spell List

This section presents the Wizard spell list. The spells are organized by spell level and then alphabetized, and each spell’s school of magic is listed. In the Special column, _C_ means the spell requires Concentration, _R_ means it’s a Ritual, and _M_ means it requires a specific Material component.

### [](#WizardSubclasses)Wizard Subclasses

A Wizard subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Wizard levels, as specified in the subclass. This section presents the [Abjurer](#Abjurer), [Diviner](#Diviner), [Evoker](#Evoker), and [Illusionist](#Illusionist) subclasses.

#### [](#Abjurer)Abjurer

_Shield Companions and Banish Foes_

Your study of magic is focused on spells that block, banish, or protect—ending harmful effects, banishing evil influences, and protecting the weak. Abjurers are sought when baleful spirits require exorcism, when locations must be guarded against magical spying, and when portals to other planes of existence must be closed. Adventuring parties value Abjurers for the protection they provide against a variety of hostile magic and other attacks.

##### [](#Level3AbjurationSavant)Level 3: Abjuration Savant

Choose two Wizard spells from the Abjuration school, each of which must be no higher than level 2, and add them to your spellbook for free.

In addition, whenever you gain access to a new level of spell slots in this class, you can add one Wizard spell from the Abjuration school to your spellbook for free. The chosen spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

##### [](#Level3ArcaneWard)Level 3: Arcane Ward

You can weave magic around yourself for protection. When you cast an Abjuration spell with a spell slot, you can simultaneously use a strand of the spell’s magic to create a magical ward on yourself that lasts until you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest). The ward has a Hit Point maximum equal to twice your Wizard level plus your Intelligence modifier. Whenever you take damage, the ward takes the damage instead, and if you have any Resistances or Vulnerabilities, apply them before reducing the ward’s Hit Points. If the damage reduces the ward to 0 Hit Points, you take any remaining damage. While the ward has 0 Hit Points, it can’t absorb damage, but its magic remains.

Whenever you cast an Abjuration spell with a spell slot, the ward regains a number of Hit Points equal to twice the level of the spell slot. Alternatively, as a Bonus Action, you can expend a spell slot, and the ward regains a number of Hit Points equal to twice the level of the spell slot expended.

Abjurer Subclass

Once you create the ward, you can’t create it again until you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

##### [](#Level6ProjectedWard)Level 6: Projected Ward

When a creature that you can see within 30 feet of yourself takes damage, you can take a Reaction to cause your Arcane Ward to absorb that damage. If this damage reduces the ward to 0 Hit Points, the warded creature takes any remaining damage. If that creature has any Resistances or Vulnerabilities, apply them before reducing the ward’s Hit Points.

##### [](#Level10SpellBreaker)Level 10: Spell Breaker

You always have the [Counterspell](/spells/2619072-counterspell) and [Dispel Magic](/spells/2619103-dispel-magic) spells prepared. In addition, you can cast _Dispel Magic_ as a Bonus Action, and you can add your Proficiency Bonus to its ability check.

When you cast either spell with a spell slot, that slot isn’t expended if the spell fails to stop a spell.

##### [](#Level14SpellResistance)Level 14: Spell Resistance

You have [Advantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Advantage) on saving throws against spells, and you have Resistance to the damage of spells.

#### [](#Diviner)Diviner

_Learn the Secrets of the Multiverse_

The counsel of a Diviner is sought by those who want a clearer understanding of the past, present, and future. As a Diviner, you strive to part the veils of space, time, and consciousness. You work to master spells of discernment, remote viewing, supernatural knowledge, and foresight.

Diviner Subclass

##### [](#Level3DivinationSavant)Level 3: Divination Savant

Choose two Wizard spells from the Divination school, each of which must be no higher than level 2, and add them to your spellbook for free.

In addition, whenever you gain access to a new level of spell slots in this class, you can add one Wizard spell from the Divination school to your spellbook for free. The chosen spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

##### [](#Level3Portent)Level 3: Portent

Glimpses of the future begin to press on your awareness. Whenever you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest), roll two d20s and record the numbers rolled. You can replace any [D20 Test](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#D20Test) made by you or a creature that you can see with one of these foretelling rolls. You must choose to do so before the roll, and you can replace a roll in this way only once per turn.

Each foretelling roll can be used only once. When you finish a Long Rest, you lose any unused foretelling rolls.

##### [](#Level6ExpertDivination)Level 6: Expert Divination

Casting Divination spells comes so easily to you that it expends only a fraction of your spellcasting efforts. When you cast a Divination spell using a level 2+ spell slot, you regain one expended spell slot. The slot you regain must be of a level lower than the slot you expended and can’t be higher than level 5.

##### [](#Level10TheThirdEye)Level 10: The Third Eye

You can increase your powers of perception. As a Bonus Action, choose one of the following benefits, which lasts until you start a [Short](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest) or [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest). You can’t use this feature again until you finish a Short or Long Rest.

**_Darkvision._** You gain [Darkvision](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Darkvision) with a range of 120 feet.

**_Greater Comprehension._** You can read any language.

**_See Invisibility._** You can cast [See Invisibility](/spells/2619011-see-invisibility) without expending a spell slot.

##### [](#Level14GreaterPortent)Level 14: Greater Portent

The visions in your dreams intensify and paint a more accurate picture in your mind of what is to come. Roll three d20s for your Portent feature rather than two.

#### [](#Evoker)Evoker

CAROLINE GARIBA [![](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/phb/MKDHZ1nxSXDDLOw2/04-040.evoker.png)](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/phb/MKDHZ1nxSXDDLOw2/04-040.evoker.png)

Evoker Subclass

_Create Explosive Elemental Effects_

Your studies focus on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some Evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast armies from afar. Others use their power to protect others, while some seek their own gain.

##### [](#Level3EvocationSavant)Level 3: Evocation Savant

Choose two Wizard spells from the Evocation school, each of which must be no higher than level 2, and add them to your spellbook for free.

In addition, whenever you gain access to a new level of spell slots in this class, you can add one Wizard spell from the Evocation school to your spellbook for free. The chosen spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

##### [](#Level3PotentCantrip)Level 3: Potent Cantrip

Your damaging cantrips affect even creatures that avoid the brunt of the effect. When you cast a cantrip at a creature and you miss with the attack roll or the target succeeds on a saving throw against the cantrip, the target takes half the cantrip’s damage (if any) but suffers no additional effect from the cantrip.

##### [](#Level6SculptSpells)Level 6: Sculpt Spells

You can create pockets of relative safety within the effects of your evocations. When you cast an Evocation spell that affects other creatures that you can see, you can choose a number of them equal to 1 plus the spell’s level. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and they take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful save.

##### [](#Level10EmpoweredEvocation)Level 10: Empowered Evocation

Whenever you cast a Wizard spell from the Evocation school, you can add your Intelligence modifier to one damage roll of that spell.

##### [](#Level14Overchannel)Level 14: Overchannel

You can increase the power of your spells. When you cast a Wizard spell with a spell slot of levels 1–5 that deals damage, you can deal maximum damage with that spell on the turn you cast it.

The first time you do so, you suffer no adverse effect. If you use this feature again before you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest), you take 2d12 Necrotic damage for each level of the spell slot immediately after you cast it. This damage ignores Resistance and Immunity.

Each time you use this feature again before finishing a Long Rest, the Necrotic damage per spell level increases by 1d12.

#### [](#Illusionist)Illusionist

_Weave Subtle Spells of Deception_

You specialize in magic that dazzles the senses and tricks the mind, and the illusions you craft make the impossible seem real.

POLAR ENGINE [![](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/phb/MKDHZ1nxSXDDLOw2/04-041.illusionist.png)](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/phb/MKDHZ1nxSXDDLOw2/04-041.illusionist.png)

Illusionist Subclass

##### [](#Level3IllusionSavant)Level 3: Illusion Savant

Choose two Wizard spells from the Illusion school, each of which must be no higher than level 2, and add them to your spellbook for free.

In addition, whenever you gain access to a new level of spell slots in this class, you can add one Wizard spell from the Illusion school to your spellbook for free. The chosen spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

##### [](#Level3ImprovedIllusions)Level 3: Improved Illusions

You can cast Illusion spells without providing Verbal components, and if an Illusion spell you cast has a range of 10+ feet, the range increases by 60 feet.

You also know the [Minor Illusion](/spells/2619039-minor-illusion) cantrip. If you already know it, you learn a different Wizard cantrip of your choice. The cantrip doesn’t count against your number of cantrips known. You can create both a sound and an image with a single casting of _Minor Illusion_, and you can cast it as a Bonus Action.

##### [](#Level6PhantasmalCreatures)Level 6: Phantasmal Creatures

You always have the [Summon Beast](/spells/2619106-summon-beast) and [Summon Fey](/spells/2619115-summon-fey) spells prepared. Whenever you cast either spell, you can change its school to Illusion, which causes the summoned creature to appear spectral. You can cast the Illusion version of each spell without expending a spell slot, but casting it without a slot halves the creature’s Hit Points. Once you cast either spell without a spell slot, you must finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest) before you can cast the spell in that way again.

##### [](#Level10IllusorySelf)Level 10: Illusory Self

When a creature hits you with an attack roll, you can take a Reaction to interpose an illusory duplicate of yourself between the attacker and yourself. The attack automatically misses you, then the illusion dissipates.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a [Short](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest) or [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest). You can also restore your use of it by expending a level 2+ spell slot (no action required).

##### [](#Level14IllusoryReality)Level 14: Illusory Reality

You have learned to weave shadow magic into your illusions to give them a semi-reality. When you cast an Illusion spell with a spell slot, you can choose one inanimate, nonmagical object that is part of the illusion and make that object real. You can do this on your turn as a Bonus Action while the spell is ongoing. The object remains real for 1 minute, during which it can’t deal damage or give any conditions. For example, you can create an illusion of a bridge over a chasm and then make it real and cross it.
