Barbarians are mighty warriors who are powered by primal forces of the multiverse that manifest as a Rage. More than a mere emotion—and not limited to anger—this Rage is an incarnation of a predator’s ferocity, a storm’s fury, and a sea’s turmoil.

Some Barbarians personify their Rage as a fierce spirit or revered forebear. Others see it as a connection to the pain and anguish of the world, as an impersonal tangle of wild magic, or as an expression of their own deepest self. For every Barbarian, their Rage is a power that fuels not just battle prowess, but also uncanny reflexes and heightened senses.

Barbarians often serve as protectors and leaders in their communities. They charge headlong into danger so those under their protection don’t have to. Their courage in the face of danger makes Barbarians perfectly suited for adventure.

#### [](#Level1Rage)Level 1: Rage

You can imbue yourself with a primal power called Rage, a force that grants you extraordinary might and resilience. You can enter it as a Bonus Action if you aren’t wearing Heavy armor.

You can enter your Rage the number of times shown for your Barbarian level in the Rages column of the Barbarian Features table. You regain one expended use when you finish a [Short Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

While active, your Rage follows the rules below.

**_Damage Resistance._** You have Resistance to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage.

**_Rage Damage._** When you make an attack using Strength—with either a weapon or an [Unarmed Strike](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike)—and deal damage to the target, you gain a bonus to the damage that increases as you gain levels as a Barbarian, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian Features table.

**_Strength Advantage._** You have Advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.

**_No Concentration or Spells._** You can’t maintain [Concentration](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration), and you can’t cast spells.

**_Duration._** The Rage lasts until the end of your next turn, and it ends early if you don Heavy armor or have the [Incapacitated](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition. If your Rage is still active on your next turn, you can extend the Rage for another round by doing one of the following:

*   Make an attack roll against an enemy.
*   Force an enemy to make a saving throw.
*   Take a Bonus Action to extend your Rage.

Each time the Rage is extended, it lasts until the end of your next turn. You can maintain a Rage for up to 10 minutes.

#### [](#Level1BarbarianUnarmoredDefense)Level 1: Unarmored Defense

While you aren’t wearing any armor, your base [Armor Class](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ArmorClass) equals 10 plus your Dexterity and Constitution modifiers. You can use a Shield and still gain this benefit.

#### [](#Level1BarbarianWeaponMastery)Level 1: Weapon Mastery

Your training with weapons allows you to use the [mastery properties](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/equipment#MasteryProperties) of two kinds of Simple or Martial Melee weapons of your choice, such as Greataxes and Handaxes. Whenever you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest), you can practice weapon drills and change one of those weapon choices.

When you reach certain Barbarian levels, you gain the ability to use the mastery properties of more kinds of weapons, as shown in the Weapon Mastery column of the [Barbarian Features table](#BarbarianFeatures).

#### [](#Level2DangerSense)Level 2: Danger Sense

You gain an uncanny sense of when things aren’t as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge perils. You have [Advantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Advantage) on Dexterity saving throws unless you have the [Incapacitated](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition.

#### [](#Level2RecklessAttack)Level 2: Reckless Attack

You can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with increased ferocity. When you make your first attack roll on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you [Advantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Advantage) on attack rolls using Strength until the start of your next turn, but attack rolls against you have Advantage during that time.

#### [](#Level3BarbarianSubclass)Level 3: Barbarian Subclass

You gain a Barbarian subclass of your choice. The [Path of the Berserker](#PathoftheBerserker), [Path of the Wild Heart](#PathoftheWildHeart), [Path of the World Tree](#PathoftheWorldTree), and [Path of the Zealot](#PathoftheZealot) subclasses are detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Barbarian levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Barbarian level or lower.

#### [](#Level3PrimalKnowledge)Level 3: Primal Knowledge

You gain proficiency in another skill of your choice from the skill list available to Barbarians at [level 1](#CoreBarbarianTraits).

In addition, while your Rage is active, you can channel primal power when you attempt certain tasks; whenever you make an ability check using one of the following skills, you can make it as a Strength check even if it normally uses a different ability: [Acrobatics](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills), [Intimidation](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills), [Perception](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills), [Stealth](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills), or [Survival](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills). When you use this ability, your Strength represents primal power coursing through you, honing your agility, bearing, and senses.

#### [](#Level4BarbarianAbilityScoreImprovement)Level 4: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see [chapter 5](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/feats#AbilityScoreImprovement)) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Barbarian levels 8, 12, and 16.

#### [](#Level5ExtraAttack)Level 5: Extra Attack

You can attack twice instead of once whenever you take the [Attack](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#AttackAction) action on your turn.

#### [](#Level5FastMovement)Level 5: Fast Movement

Your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren’t wearing Heavy armor.

#### [](#Level7FeralInstinct)Level 7: Feral Instinct

Your instincts are so honed that you have [Advantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Advantage) on [Initiative](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Initiative) rolls.

#### [](#Level7InstinctivePounce)Level 7: Instinctive Pounce

As part of the Bonus Action you take to enter your Rage, you can move up to half your Speed.

#### [](#Level9BrutalStrike)Level 9: Brutal Strike

If you use Reckless Attack, you can forgo any [Advantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Advantage) on one Strength-based attack roll of your choice on your turn. The chosen attack roll mustn’t have [Disadvantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Disadvantage). If the chosen attack roll hits, the target takes an extra 1d10 damage of the same type dealt by the weapon or [Unarmed Strike](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike), and you can cause one Brutal Strike effect of your choice. You have the following effect options.

**_Forceful Blow._** The target is pushed 15 feet straight away from you. You can then move up to half your Speed straight toward the target without provoking [Opportunity Attacks](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#OpportunityAttack).

**_Hamstring Blow._** The target’s Speed is reduced by 15 feet until the start of your next turn. A target can be affected by only one Hamstring Blow at a time—the most recent one.

#### [](#Level11RelentlessRage)Level 11: Relentless Rage

Your Rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 Hit Points while your Rage is active and don’t die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, your Hit Points instead change to a number equal to twice your Barbarian level.

Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a [Short](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest) or [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest), the DC resets to 10.

#### [](#Level13ImprovedBrutalStrike)Level 13: Improved Brutal Strike

You have honed new ways to attack furiously. The following effects are now among your Brutal Strike options.

**_Staggering Blow._** The target has [Disadvantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Disadvantage) on the next saving throw it makes, and it can’t make [Opportunity Attacks](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#OpportunityAttack) until the start of your next turn.

**_Sundering Blow._** Before the start of your next turn, the next attack roll made by another creature against the target gains a +5 bonus to the roll. An attack roll can gain only one Sundering Blow bonus.

#### [](#Level15PersistentRage)Level 15: Persistent Rage

When you roll [Initiative](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Initiative), you can regain all expended uses of Rage. After you regain uses of Rage in this way, you can’t do so again until you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

In addition, your Rage is so fierce that it now lasts for 10 minutes without you needing to do anything to extend it from round to round. Your Rage ends early if you have the [Unconscious](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnconsciousCondition) condition (not just the [Incapacitated](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition) or don Heavy armor.

#### [](#Level17ImprovedBrutalStrike)Level 17: Improved Brutal Strike

The extra damage of your Brutal Strike increases to 2d10. In addition, you can use two different Brutal Strike effects whenever you use your Brutal Strike feature.

#### [](#Level18IndomitableMight)Level 18: Indomitable Might

If your total for a Strength check or Strength saving throw is less than your Strength score, you can use that score in place of the total.

#### [](#Level19BarbarianEpicBoon)Level 19: Epic Boon

You gain an Epic Boon feat (see [chapter 5](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/feats#EpicBoonFeats)) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. [Boon of Irresistible Offense](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/feats#BoonofIrresistibleOffense) is recommended.

#### [](#Level20PrimalChampion)Level 20: Primal Champion

You embody primal power. Your Strength and Constitution scores increase by 4, to a maximum of 25.

### [](#BarbarianSubclasses)Barbarian Subclasses

A Barbarian subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Barbarian levels, as specified in the subclass. This section presents the [Path of the Berserker](#PathoftheBerserker), [Path of the Wild Heart](#PathoftheWildHeart), [Path of the World Tree](#PathoftheWorldTree), and [Path of the Zealot](#PathoftheZealot) subclasses.

#### [](#PathoftheBerserker)Path of the Berserker

Path of the Berserker Subclass

_Channel Rage into Violent Fury_

Barbarians who walk the Path of the Berserker direct their Rage primarily toward violence. Their path is one of untrammeled fury, and they thrill in the chaos of battle as they allow their Rage to seize and empower them.

##### [](#Level3Frenzy)Level 3: Frenzy

If you use Reckless Attack while your Rage is active, you deal extra damage to the first target you hit on your turn with a Strength-based attack. To determine the extra damage, roll a number of d6s equal to your Rage Damage bonus, and add them together. The damage has the same type as the weapon or [Unarmed Strike](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike) used for the attack.

##### [](#Level6MindlessRage)Level 6: Mindless Rage

You have Immunity to the [Charmed](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CharmedCondition) and [Frightened](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition) conditions while your Rage is active. If you’re Charmed or Frightened when you enter your Rage, the condition ends on you.

##### [](#Level10Retaliation)Level 10: Retaliation

When you take damage from a creature that is within 5 feet of you, you can take a Reaction to make one melee attack against that creature, using a weapon or an [Unarmed Strike](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike).

##### [](#Level14IntimidatingPresence)Level 14: Intimidating Presence

Invoking magic through music, dance, and verse, Bards are expert at inspiring others, soothing hurts, disheartening foes, and creating illusions. Bards believe the multiverse was spoken into existence and that remnants of its Words of Creation still resound and glimmer on every plane of existence. Bardic magic attempts to harness those words, which transcend any language.

Anything can inspire a new song or tale, so Bards are fascinated by almost everything. They become masters of many things, including performing music, working magic, and making jests.

A Bard’s life is spent traveling, gathering lore, telling stories, and living on the gratitude of audiences, much like any other entertainer. But Bards’ depth of knowledge and mastery of magic sets them apart.

#### [](#Level1BardicInspiration)Level 1: Bardic Inspiration

You can supernaturally inspire others through words, music, or dance. This inspiration is represented by your Bardic Inspiration die, which is a d6.

**_Using Bardic Inspiration._** As a Bonus Action, you can inspire another creature within 60 feet of yourself who can see or hear you. That creature gains one of your Bardic Inspiration dice. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.

Once within the next hour when the creature fails a [D20 Test](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#D20Test), the creature can roll the Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to the d20, potentially turning the failure into a success. A Bardic Inspiration die is expended when it’s rolled.

**_Number of Uses._** You can confer a Bardic Inspiration die a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

**_At Higher Levels._** Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain Bard levels, as shown in the Bardic Die column of the Bard Features table. The die becomes a d8 at level 5, a d10 at level 10, and a d12 at level 15.

#### [](#Level1BardSpellcasting)Level 1: Spellcasting

You have learned to cast spells through your bardic arts. See [chapter 7](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/spells/) for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Bard spells, which appear in the [Bard spell list](#BardSpellList) later in the class’s description.

**_Cantrips._** You know two cantrips of your choice from the Bard spell list. [Dancing Lights](/spells/2619058-dancing-lights) and [Vicious Mockery](/spells/2619216-vicious-mockery) are recommended.

Whenever you gain a Bard level, you can replace one of your cantrips with another cantrip of your choice from the Bard spell list.

When you reach Bard levels 4 and 10, you learn another cantrip of your choice from the Bard spell list, as shown in the Cantrips column of the [Bard Features table](#BardFeatures).

**_Spell Slots._** The Bard Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

**_Prepared Spells of Level 1+._** You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose four level 1 spells from the Bard spell list. [Charm Person](/spells/2618964-charm-person), [Color Spray](/spells/2618978-color-spray), [Dissonant Whispers](/spells/2619104-dissonant-whispers), and [Healing Word](/spells/2619143-healing-word) are recommended.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Bard levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the [Bard Features table](#BardFeatures). Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Bard spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 3 Bard, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination.

If another Bard feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Bard spells for you.

**_Changing Your Prepared Spells._** Whenever you gain a Bard level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Bard spell for which you have spell slots.

**_Spellcasting Ability._** Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Bard spells.

**_Spellcasting Focus._** You can use a **[Musical Instrument](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/equipment#MusicalInstrumentVaries)** as a Spellcasting Focus for your Bard spells.

#### [](#Level2Expertise)Level 2: Expertise

[Performance](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills) and [Persuasion](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills) are recommended if you have proficiency in them.

At Bard level 9, you gain Expertise in two more of your skill proficiencies of your choice.

#### [](#Level2JackofAllTrades)Level 2: Jack of All Trades

You can add half your Proficiency Bonus (round down) to any ability check you make that uses a skill proficiency you lack and that doesn’t otherwise use your Proficiency Bonus.

For example, if you make a Strength ([Athletics](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check and lack [Athletics](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills) proficiency, you can add half your Proficiency Bonus to the check.

A Bard’s Repertoire

Does your Bard beat a drum while chanting the deeds of ancient heroes? Strum a lute while crooning romantic tunes? Perform arias of stirring power? Recite dramatic monologues from classic tragedies? Use the rhythm of a folk dance to coordinate the movement of allies in battle? Compose naughty limericks?

When you play a Bard, consider the style of artistic performance you favor, the moods you might invoke, and the themes that inspire your own creations. Are your poems inspired by moments of natural beauty, or are they brooding reflections on loss? Do you prefer lofty hymns or rowdy tavern songs? Are you drawn to laments for the fallen or celebrations of joy? Do you dance merry jigs or perform elaborate interpretive choreography? Do you focus on one style of performance or strive to master them all?

#### [](#Level3BardSubclass)Level 3: Bard Subclass

You gain a Bard subclass of your choice. The [College of Dance](#CollegeofDance), [College of Glamour](#CollegeofGlamour), [College of Lore](#CollegeofLore), and [College of Valor](#CollegeofValor) subclasses are detailed after this class’s description.

#### [](#Level10MagicalSecrets)Level 10: Magical Secrets

You’ve learned secrets from various magical traditions. Whenever you reach a Bard level (including this level) and the Prepared Spells number in the Bard Features table increases, you can choose any of your new prepared spells from the [Bard](#BardSpellList), [Cleric](#ClericSpellList), [Druid](#DruidSpellList), and [Wizard](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#WizardSpellList) spell lists, and the chosen spells count as Bard spells for you (see a class’s section for its spell list). In addition, whenever you replace a spell prepared for this class, you can replace it with a spell from those lists.

#### [](#Level18SuperiorInspiration)Level 18: Superior Inspiration

When you roll Initiative, you regain expended uses of Bardic Inspiration until you have two if you have fewer than that.

#### [](#Level19BardEpicBoon)Level 19: Epic Boon

### [](#BardSubclasses)Bard Subclasses

A Bard subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Bard levels, as specified in the subclass. Bards form loose associations, which they call colleges, to preserve their traditions. This section presents the [College of Dance](#CollegeofDance), [College of Glamour](#CollegeofGlamour), [College of Lore](#CollegeofLore), and [College of Valor](#CollegeofValor) subclasses.

College of Dance Subclass

_Move in Harmony with the Cosmos_

Bards of the College of Dance know that the Words of Creation can’t be contained within speech or song; the words are uttered by the movements of celestial bodies and flow through the motions of the smallest creatures. These Bards practice a way of being in harmony with the whirling cosmos that emphasizes agility, speed, and grace.

##### [](#Level3DazzlingFootwork)Level 3: Dazzling Footwork

While you aren’t wearing armor or wielding a Shield, you gain the following benefits.

**_Dance Virtuoso._** You have [Advantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Advantage) on any Charisma ([Performance](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check you make that involves you dancing.

**_Unarmored Defense._** Your base [Armor Class](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ArmorClass) equals 10 plus your Dexterity and Charisma modifiers.

**_Agile Strikes._** When you expend a use of your Bardic Inspiration as part of an action, a Bonus Action, or a Reaction, you can make one [Unarmed Strike](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike) as part of that action, Bonus Action, or Reaction.

**_Bardic Damage._** You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack rolls of your [Unarmed Strikes](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike). When you deal damage with an Unarmed Strike, you can deal Bludgeoning damage equal to a roll of your Bardic Inspiration die plus your Dexterity modifier, instead of the strike’s normal damage. This roll doesn’t expend the die.

##### [](#Level6InspiringMovement)Level 6: Inspiring Movement

When an enemy you can see ends its turn within 5 feet of you, you can take a Reaction and expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to move up to half your Speed. Then one ally of your choice within 30 feet of you can also move up to half their Speed using their Reaction.

None of this feature’s movement provokes [Opportunity Attacks](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#OpportunityAttack).

##### [](#Level6TandemFootwork)Level 6: Tandem Footwork

When you roll [Initiative](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Initiative), you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration if you don’t have the [Incapacitated](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition. When you do so, roll your Bardic Inspiration die; you and each ally within 30 feet of you who can see or hear you gains a bonus to Initiative equal to the number rolled.

##### [](#Level14LeadingEvasion)Level 14: Leading Evasion

When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw and only half damage if you fail. If any creatures within 5 feet of you are making the same Dexterity saving throw, you can share this benefit with them for that save.

You can’t use this feature if you have the [Incapacitated](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition.

#### [](#CollegeofGlamour)College of Glamour

_Weave Beguiling Fey Magic_

The College of Glamour traces its origins to the beguiling magic of the Feywild. Bards who study this magic weave threads of beauty and terror into their songs and stories, and the mightiest among them can cloak themselves in otherworldly majesty. Their performances stir up wistful longing for forgotten innocence, evoke unconscious memories of long-held fears, and tug at the emotions of even the most hard-hearted listeners.

College of Glamour Subclass

##### [](#Level3BeguilingMagic)Level 3: Beguiling Magic

You always have the [Charm Person](/spells/2618964-charm-person) and [Mirror Image](/spells/2619060-mirror-image) spells prepared.

In addition, immediately after you cast an Enchantment or Illusion spell using a spell slot, you can cause a creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the target has the [Charmed](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CharmedCondition) or [Frightened](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition) condition (your choice) for 1 minute. The target repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Once you use this benefit, you can’t use it again until you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest). You can also restore your use of it by expending one use of your Bardic Inspiration (no action required).

##### [](#Level3MantleofInspiration)Level 3: Mantle of Inspiration

You can weave fey magic into a song or dance to fill others with vigor. As a Bonus Action, you can expend a use of Bardic Inspiration, rolling a Bardic Inspiration die. When you do so, choose a number of other creatures within 60 feet of yourself, up to a number equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature). Each of those creatures gains a number of [Temporary Hit Points](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#TemporaryHitPoints) equal to two times the number rolled on the Bardic Inspiration die, and then each can use its Reaction to move up to its Speed without provoking [Opportunity Attacks](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#OpportunityAttack).

##### [](#Level6MantleofMajesty)Level 6: Mantle of Majesty

You always have the [Command](/spells/2618985-command) spell prepared.

As a Bonus Action, you cast _Command_ without expending a spell slot, and you take on an unearthly appearance for 1 minute or until your [Concentration](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration) ends. During this time, you can cast _Command_ as a Bonus Action without expending a spell slot.

Any creature [Charmed](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CharmedCondition) by you automatically fails its saving throw against the _Command_ you cast with this feature.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest). You can also restore your use of it by expending a level 3+ spell slot (no action required).

##### [](#Level14UnbreakableMajesty)Level 14: Unbreakable Majesty

As a Bonus Action, you can assume a magically majestic presence for 1 minute or until you have the [Incapacitated](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition. For the duration, whenever any creature hits you with an attack roll for the first time on a turn, the attacker must succeed on a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC, or the attack misses instead, as the creature recoils from your majesty.

Once you assume this majestic presence, you can’t do so again until you finish a [Short](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest) or [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

#### [](#CollegeofLore)College of Lore

College of Lore Subclass

_Plumb the Depths of Magical Knowledge_

Bards of the College of Lore collect spells and secrets from diverse sources, such as scholarly tomes, mystical rites, and peasant tales. The college’s members gather in libraries and universities to share their lore with one another. They also meet at festivals or affairs of state, where they can expose corruption, unravel lies, and poke fun at self-important figures of authority.

##### [](#Level3BonusProficiencies)Level 3: Bonus Proficiencies

You gain proficiency with three skills of your choice.

##### [](#Level3CuttingWords)Level 3: Cutting Words

You learn to use your wit to supernaturally distract, confuse, and otherwise sap the confidence and competence of others. When a creature that you can see within 60 feet of yourself makes a damage roll or succeeds on an ability check or attack roll, you can take a Reaction to expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration; roll your Bardic Inspiration die, and subtract the number rolled from the creature’s roll, reducing the damage or potentially turning the success into a failure.

##### [](#Level6MagicalDiscoveries)Level 6: Magical Discoveries

You learn two spells of your choice. These spells can come from the [Cleric](#ClericSpellList), [Druid](#DruidSpellList), or [Wizard](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#WizardSpellList) spell list or any combination thereof (see a class’s section for its spell list). A spell you choose must be a cantrip or a spell for which you have spell slots, as shown in the [Bard Features table](#BardFeatures).

You always have the chosen spells prepared, and whenever you gain a Bard level, you can replace one of the spells with another spell that meets these requirements.

##### [](#Level14PeerlessSkill)Level 14: Peerless Skill

When you make an ability check or attack roll and fail, you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration; roll the Bardic Inspiration die, and add the number rolled to the d20, potentially turning a failure into a success. On a failure, the Bardic Inspiration isn’t expended.

#### [](#CollegeofValor)College of Valor

_Sing the Deeds of Ancient Heroes_

IGNATIUS BUDI [![](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/phb/MKDHZ1nxSXDDLOw2/03-025.college-of-valor.png)](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/phb/MKDHZ1nxSXDDLOw2/03-025.college-of-valor.png)

College of Valor Subclass

Bards of the College of Valor are daring storytellers whose tales preserve the memory of the great heroes of the past. These Bards sing the deeds of the mighty in vaulted halls or to crowds gathered around great bonfires. They travel to witness great events firsthand and to ensure that the memory of these events doesn’t pass away. With their songs, they inspire new generations to reach the same heights of accomplishment as the heroes of old.

##### [](#Level3CombatInspiration)Level 3: Combat Inspiration

You can use your wit to turn the tide of battle. A creature that has a Bardic Inspiration die from you can use it for one of the following effects.

**_Defense._** When the creature is hit by an attack roll, that creature can use its Reaction to roll the Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to its AC against that attack, potentially causing the attack to miss.

**_Offense._** Immediately after the creature hits a target with an attack roll, the creature can roll the Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to the attack’s damage against the target.

##### [](#Level3MartialTraining)Level 3: Martial Training

You gain proficiency with Martial weapons and training with Medium armor and Shields.

In addition, you can use a Simple or Martial weapon as a Spellcasting Focus to cast spells from your Bard spell list.

##### [](#Level6ExtraAttack)Level 6: Extra Attack

You can attack twice instead of once whenever you take the [Attack](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#AttackAction) action on your turn.

Clerics draw power from the realms of the gods and harness it to work miracles. Blessed by a deity, a pantheon, or another immortal entity, a Cleric can reach out to the divine magic of the Outer Planes—where gods dwell—and channel it to bolster people and battle foes.

Because their power is a divine gift, Clerics typically associate themselves with temples dedicated to the deity or other immortal force that unlocked their magic. Harnessing divine magic doesn’t rely on specific training, yet Clerics might learn prayers and rites that help them draw on power from the Outer Planes.

Not every member of a temple or shrine is a Cleric. Some priests are called to a simple life of temple service, carrying out their devotion through prayer and rituals, not through magic. Many mortals claim to speak for the gods, but few can marshal the power of those gods the way a Cleric can.

#### [](#Level1ClericSpellcasting)Level 1: Spellcasting

You have learned to cast spells through prayer and meditation. See [chapter 7](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/spells/) for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Cleric spells, which appear on the [Cleric spell list](#ClericSpellList) later in the class’s description.

**_Cantrips._** You know three cantrips of your choice from the Cleric spell list. [Guidance](/spells/2618971-guidance), [Sacred Flame](/spells/2618967-sacred-flame), and [Thaumaturgy](/spells/2619174-thaumaturgy) are recommended.

Whenever you gain a Cleric level, you can replace one of your cantrips with another cantrip of your choice from the Cleric spell list.

When you reach Cleric levels 4 and 10, you learn another cantrip of your choice from the Cleric spell list, as shown in the Cantrips column of the [Cleric Features table](#ClericFeatures).

**_Spell Slots._** The Cleric Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

**_Prepared Spells of Level 1+._** You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose four level 1 spells from the Cleric spell list. [Bless](/spells/2618933-bless), [Cure Wounds](/spells/2619079-cure-wounds), [Guiding Bolt](/spells/2619136-guiding-bolt), and [Shield of Faith](/spells/2619020-shield-of-faith) are recommended.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Cleric levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the [Cleric Features table](#ClericFeatures). Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Cleric spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 3 Cleric, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination.

If another Cleric feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Cleric spells for you.

**_Changing Your Prepared Spells._** Whenever you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest), you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells there with other Cleric spells for which you have spell slots.

**_Spellcasting Ability._** Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Cleric spells.

**_Spellcasting Focus._** You can use a [Holy Symbol](/equipment/514-holy-symbol) as a Spellcasting Focus for your Cleric spells.

#### [](#Level1DivineOrder)Level 1: Divine Order

You have dedicated yourself to one of the following sacred roles of your choice.

**_Protector._** Trained for battle, you gain proficiency with Martial weapons and training with Heavy armor.

**_Thaumaturge._** You know one extra cantrip from the [Cleric spell list](#ClericSpellList). In addition, your mystical connection to the divine gives you a bonus to your Intelligence ([Arcana](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills) or [Religion](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) checks. The bonus equals your Wisdom modifier (minimum of +1).

#### [](#Level2ClericChannelDivinity)Level 2: Channel Divinity

You can channel divine energy directly from the Outer Planes to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Divine Spark and Turn Undead, each of which is described below. Each time you use this class’s Channel Divinity, choose which Channel Divinity effect from this class to create. You gain additional effect options at higher Cleric levels.

You can use this class’s Channel Divinity twice. You regain one of its expended uses when you finish a [Short Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest). You gain additional uses when you reach certain Cleric levels, as shown in the Channel Divinity column of the [Cleric Features table](#ClericFeatures).

If a Channel Divinity effect requires a saving throw, the DC equals the spell save DC from this class’s Spellcasting feature.

**_Divine Spark._** As a [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action, you point your Holy Symbol at another creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself and focus divine energy at it. Roll 1d8 and add your Wisdom modifier. You either restore Hit Points to the creature equal to that total or force the creature to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes Necrotic or Radiant damage (your choice) equal to that total. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage (round down).

You roll an additional d8 when you reach Cleric levels 7 (2d8), 13 (3d8), and 18 (4d8).

**_Turn Undead._** As a [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action, you present your Holy Symbol and censure Undead creatures. Each Undead of your choice within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its save, it has the [Frightened](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition) and [Incapacitated](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) conditions for 1 minute. For that duration, it tries to move as far from you as it can on its turns. This effect ends early on the creature if it takes any damage, if you have the Incapacitated condition, or if you die.

#### [](#Level3ClericSubclass)Level 3: Cleric Subclass

You gain a Cleric subclass of your choice. The [Life Domain](#LifeDomain), [Light Domain](#LightDomain), [Trickery Domain](#TrickeryDomain), and [War Domain](#WarDomain) subclasses are detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Cleric levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Cleric level or lower.

#### [](#Level4ClericAbilityScoreImprovement)Level 4: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see [chapter 5](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/feats#AbilityScoreImprovement)) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Cleric levels 8, 12, and 16.

#### [](#Level5SearUndead)Level 5: Sear Undead

Whenever you use Turn Undead, you can roll a number of d8s equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1d8) and add the rolls together. Each Undead that fails its saving throw against that use of Turn Undead takes Radiant damage equal to the roll’s total. This damage doesn’t end the turn effect.

#### [](#Level7BlessedStrikes)Level 7: Blessed Strikes

Divine power infuses you in battle. You gain one of the following options of your choice (if you get either option from a Cleric subclass in an older book, use only the option you choose for this feature).

**_Divine Strike._** Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with an attack roll using a weapon, you can cause the target to take an extra 1d8 Necrotic or Radiant damage (your choice).

**_Potent Spellcasting._** Add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any Cleric cantrip.

#### [](#Level10DivineIntervention)Level 10: Divine Intervention

You can call on your deity or pantheon to intervene on your behalf. As a [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action, choose any Cleric spell of level 5 or lower that doesn’t require a Reaction to cast. As part of the same action, you cast that spell without expending a spell slot or needing Material components. You can’t use this feature again until you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

#### [](#Level14ImprovedBlessedStrikes)Level 14: Improved Blessed Strikes

The option you chose for Blessed Strikes grows more powerful.

**_Divine Strike._** The extra damage of your Divine Strike increases to 2d8.

**_Potent Spellcasting._** When you cast a Cleric cantrip and deal damage to a creature with it, you can give vitality to yourself or another creature within 60 feet of yourself, granting a number of [Temporary Hit Points](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#TemporaryHitPoints) equal to twice your Wisdom modifier.

#### [](#Level19ClericEpicBoon)Level 19: Epic Boon

You gain an Epic Boon feat (see [chapter 5](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/feats#EpicBoonFeats)) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. [Boon of Fate](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/feats#BoonofFate) is recommended.

#### [](#Level20GreaterDivineIntervention)Level 20: Greater Divine Intervention

You can call on even more powerful divine intervention. When you use your Divine Intervention feature, you can choose [Wish](/spells/2619213-wish) when you select a spell. If you do so, you can’t use Divine Intervention again until you finish 2d4 [Long Rests](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

### [](#ClericSpellList)Cleric Spell List

This section presents the Cleric spell list. The spells are organized by spell level and then alphabetized, and each spell’s school of magic is listed. In the Special column, _C_ means the spell requires Concentration, _R_ means it’s a Ritual, and _M_ means it requires a specific Material component.

### [](#ClericSubclasses)Cleric Subclasses

A Cleric subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Cleric levels, as specified in the subclass. Each Cleric subclass is named after a domain of existence that is favored by a god, pantheon, or religious order. This section presents the [Life Domain](#LifeDomain), [Light Domain](#LightDomain), [Trickery Domain](#TrickeryDomain), and [War Domain](#WarDomain) subclasses.

#### [](#LifeDomain)Life Domain

_Soothe the Hurts of the World_

The Life Domain focuses on the positive energy that helps sustain all life in the multiverse. Clerics who tap into this domain are masters of healing, using that life force to cure many hurts.

Existence itself relies on the positive energy associated with this domain, so a Cleric of almost any religious tradition might choose it. This domain is particularly associated with agricultural deities, gods of healing or endurance, and gods of home and community. Religious orders of healing also seek the magic of this domain.

##### [](#Level3DiscipleofLife)Level 3: Disciple of Life

When a spell you cast with a spell slot restores Hit Points to a creature, that creature regains additional Hit Points on the turn you cast the spell. The additional Hit Points equal 2 plus the spell slot’s level.

##### [](#Level3LifeDomainSpells)Level 3: Life Domain Spells

Your connection to this divine domain ensures you always have certain spells ready. When you reach a Cleric level specified in the Life Domain Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

##### [](#Level3PreserveLife)Level 3: Preserve Life

As a [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action, you present your Holy Symbol and expend a use of your Channel Divinity to evoke healing energy that can restore a number of Hit Points equal to five times your Cleric level. Choose [Bloodied](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Bloodied) creatures within 30 feet of yourself (which can include you), and divide those Hit Points among them. This feature can restore a creature to no more than half its Hit Point maximum.

##### [](#Level6BlessedHealer)Level 6: Blessed Healer

The healing spells you cast on others heal you as well. Immediately after you cast a spell with a spell slot that restores Hit Points to one or more creatures other than yourself, you regain Hit Points equal to 2 plus the spell slot’s level.

##### [](#Level17SupremeHealing)Level 17: Supreme Healing

When you would normally roll one or more dice to restore Hit Points to a creature with a spell or Channel Divinity, don’t roll those dice for the healing; instead use the highest number possible for each die. For example, instead of restoring 2d6 Hit Points to a creature with a spell, you restore 12.

#### [](#LightDomain)Light Domain

_Bring Light to Banish Darkness_

The Light Domain emphasizes the divine power to bring about blazing fire and revelation. Clerics who wield this power are enlightened souls infused with radiance and the power of their deities’ discerning vision, charged with chasing away lies and burning away darkness.

JODIE MUIR [![](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/phb/MKDHZ1nxSXDDLOw2/03-029.light-domain.png)](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/phb/MKDHZ1nxSXDDLOw2/03-029.light-domain.png)

Light Domain Subclass

The Light Domain is associated with gods of truth, vigilance, beauty, insight, and renewal. Some of these gods are identified with the sun or as charioteers who guide the sun across the sky. Others are sentinels who pierce deception. Some are deities of beauty and artistry who teach that art is a vehicle for the soul’s improvement.

##### [](#Level3LightDomainSpells)Level 3: Light Domain Spells

Your connection to this divine domain ensures you always have certain spells ready. When you reach a Cleric level specified in the Light Domain Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

##### [](#Level3RadianceoftheDawn)Level 3: Radiance of the Dawn

As a [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action, you present your Holy Symbol and expend a use of your Channel Divinity to emit a flash of light in a 30-foot [Emanation](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#EmanationAreaofEffect) originating from yourself. Any magical [Darkness](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Darkness)—such as that created by the [Darkness](/spells/2619080-darkness) spell—in that area is dispelled. Additionally, each creature of your choice in that area must make a Constitution saving throw, taking Radiant damage equal to 2d10 plus your Cleric level on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

##### [](#Level3WardingFlare)Level 3: Warding Flare

When a creature that you can see within 30 feet of yourself makes an attack roll, you can take a Reaction to impose [Disadvantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Disadvantage) on the attack roll, causing light to flare before it hits or misses.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

##### [](#Level6ImprovedWardingFlare)Level 6: Improved Warding Flare

You regain all expended uses of your Warding Flare when you finish a [Short](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest) or [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

In addition, whenever you use Warding Flare, you can give the target of the triggering attack a number of [Temporary Hit Points](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#TemporaryHitPoints) equal to 2d6 plus your Wisdom modifier.

##### [](#Level17CoronaofLight)Level 17: Corona of Light

As a [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action, you cause yourself to emit an aura of sunlight that lasts for 1 minute or until you dismiss it (no action required). You emit [Bright Light](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BrightLight) in a 60-foot radius and [Dim Light](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DimLight) for an additional 30 feet. Your enemies in the Bright Light have [Disadvantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Disadvantage) on saving throws against your Radiance of the Dawn and any spell that deals Fire or Radiant damage.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

#### [](#TrickeryDomain)Trickery Domain

_Make Mischief and Challenge Authority_

The Trickery Domain offers magic of deception, illusion, and stealth. Clerics who wield this magic are a disruptive force in the world, puncturing pride, mocking tyrants, freeing captives, and flouting hollow traditions. They prefer subterfuge and pranks to direct confrontation.

POLAR ENGINE [![](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/phb/MKDHZ1nxSXDDLOw2/03-030.trickery-domain.png)](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/phb/MKDHZ1nxSXDDLOw2/03-030.trickery-domain.png)

Trickery Domain Subclass

Gods of trickery are mischief-makers and instigators who stand as a constant challenge to the accepted order among both gods and mortals. They embody the forces of change and social upheaval, and they’re patrons of thieves, scoundrels, gamblers, rebels, and liberators. Religious orders that operate in secret, especially those that seek to undermine oppressive governments or hierarchies, also draw on the power of the Trickery Domain.

##### [](#Level3BlessingoftheTrickster)Level 3: Blessing of the Trickster

As a [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action, you can choose yourself or a willing creature within 30 feet of yourself to have [Advantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Advantage) on Dexterity ([Stealth](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) checks. This blessing lasts until you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest) or you use this feature again.

##### [](#Level3TrickeryDomainSpells)Level 3: Trickery Domain Spells

Your connection to this divine domain ensures you always have certain spells ready. When you reach a Cleric level specified in the Trickery Domain Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

##### [](#Level3InvokeDuplicity)Level 3: Invoke Duplicity

As a Bonus Action, you can expend one use of your Channel Divinity to create a perfect visual illusion of yourself in an unoccupied space you can see within 30 feet of yourself. The illusion is intangible and doesn’t occupy its space. It lasts for 1 minute, but it ends early if you dismiss it (no action required) or have the [Incapacitated](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition. The illusion is animated and mimics your expressions and gestures. While it persists, you gain the following benefits.

**_Cast Spells._** You can cast spells as though you were in the illusion’s space, but you must use your own senses.

**_Distract._** When both you and your illusion are within 5 feet of a creature that can see the illusion, you have [Advantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Advantage) on attack rolls against that creature, given how distracting the illusion is to the target.

**_Move._** As a Bonus Action, you can move the illusion up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see that is within 120 feet of yourself.

##### [](#Level6TrickstersTransposition)Level 6: Trickster’s Transposition

Whenever you take the Bonus Action to create or move the illusion of your Invoke Duplicity, you can teleport, swapping places with the illusion.

##### [](#Level17ImprovedDuplicity)Level 17: Improved Duplicity

The illusion of your Invoke Duplicity has grown more powerful in the following ways.

**_Shared Distraction._** When you and your allies make attack rolls against a creature within 5 feet of the illusion, the attack rolls have [Advantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Advantage).

**_Healing Illusion._** When the illusion ends, you or a creature of your choice within 5 feet of it regains a number of Hit Points equal to your Cleric level.

#### [](#WarDomain)War Domain

_Inspire Valor and Smite Foes_

War has many manifestations. It can make heroes of ordinary people. It can be desperate and horrific, with acts of cruelty and cowardice eclipsing instances of excellence and courage. Clerics who tap into the magic of the War Domain excel in battle, inspiring others to fight the good fight or offering acts of violence as prayers.

Gods of the War Domain watch over warriors and reward them for their great deeds. They include champions of honor and chivalry as well as gods of destruction and pillage. Other war gods take a more neutral stance, promoting war in all its manifestations and supporting warriors in any circumstance.

##### [](#Level3GuidedStrike)Level 3: Guided Strike

When you or a creature within 30 feet of you misses with an attack roll, you can expend one use of your Channel Divinity and give that roll a +10 bonus, potentially causing it to hit. When you use this feature to benefit another creature’s attack roll, you must take a Reaction to do so.

##### [](#Level3WarDomainSpells)Level 3: War Domain Spells

Your connection to this divine domain ensures you always have certain spells ready. When you reach a Cleric level specified in the War Domain Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

##### [](#Level3WarPriest)Level 3: War Priest

As a Bonus Action, you can make one attack with a weapon or an [Unarmed Strike](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike). You can use this Bonus Action a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a [Short](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest) or [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

##### [](#Level6WarGodsBlessing)Level 6: War God’s Blessing

You can expend a use of your Channel Divinity to cast [Shield of Faith](/spells/2619020-shield-of-faith) or [Spiritual Weapon](/spells/2619081-spiritual-weapon) rather than expending a spell slot. When you cast either spell in this way, the spell doesn’t require [Concentration](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration). Instead the spell lasts for 1 minute, but it ends early if you cast that spell again, have the [Incapacitated](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition, or die.

##### [](#Level17AvatarofBattle)Level 17: Avatar of Battle

You gain Resistance to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage.

Druids belong to ancient orders that call on the forces of nature. Harnessing the magic of animals, plants, and the four elements, Druids heal, transform into animals, and wield elemental destruction.

Revering nature above all, individual Druids gain their magic from nature, a nature deity, or both, and they typically unite with other Druids to perform rites that mark the passage of the seasons and other natural cycles.

Druids are concerned with the delicate ecological balance that sustains plant and animal life and with the need for people to live in harmony with nature. Druids often guard sacred sites or watch over regions of unspoiled nature, but when a significant danger arises, Druids take a more active role as adventurers who combat the threat.

#### [](#Level1DruidSpellcasting)Level 1: Spellcasting

You have learned to cast spells through studying the mystical forces of nature. See [chapter 7](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/spells/) for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Druid spells, which appear on the [Druid spell list](#DruidSpellList) later in the class’s description.

**_Cantrips._** You know two cantrips of your choice from the Druid spell list. [Druidcraft](/spells/2619158-druidcraft) and [Produce Flame](/spells/2618901-produce-flame) are recommended.

Whenever you gain a Druid level, you can replace one of your cantrips with another cantrip of your choice from the Druid spell list.

When you reach Druid levels 4 and 10, you learn another cantrip of your choice from the Druid spell list, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Druid Features table.

**_Spell Slots._** The Druid Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

**_Prepared Spells of Level 1+._** You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose four level 1 spells from the Druid spell list. [Animal Friendship](/spells/2618847-animal-friendship), [Cure Wounds](/spells/2619079-cure-wounds), [Faerie Fire](/spells/2618858-faerie-fire), and [Thunderwave](/spells/2619184-thunderwave) are recommended.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Druid levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Druid Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Druid spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 3 Druid, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination.

If another Druid feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Druid spells for you.

**_Changing Your Prepared Spells._** Whenever you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest), you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells with other Druid spells for which you have spell slots.

**_Spellcasting Ability._** Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Druid spells.

**_Spellcasting Focus._** You can use a [Druidic Focus](/equipment/532-druidic-focus) as a Spellcasting Focus for your Druid spells.

#### [](#Level1Druidic)Level 1: Druidic

You know Druidic, the secret language of Druids. While learning this ancient tongue, you also unlocked the magic of communicating with animals; you always have the [Speak with Animals](/spells/2619059-speak-with-animals) spell prepared.

You can use Druidic to leave hidden messages. You and others who know Druidic automatically spot such a message. Others spot the message’s presence with a successful DC 15 Intelligence ([Investigation](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check but can’t decipher it without magic.

#### [](#Level1PrimalOrder)Level 1: Primal Order

You have dedicated yourself to one of the following sacred roles of your choice.

**_Magician._** You know one extra cantrip from the [Druid spell list](#DruidSpellList). In addition, your mystical connection to nature gives you a bonus to your Intelligence ([Arcana](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills) or [Nature](/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) checks. The bonus equals your Wisdom modifier (minimum bonus of +1).

**_Warden._** Trained for battle, you gain proficiency with Martial weapons and training with Medium armor.

#### [](#Level2WildShape)Level 2: Wild Shape

The power of nature allows you to assume the form of an animal. As a Bonus Action, you shape-shift into a Beast form that you have learned for this feature (see “Known Forms” below). You stay in that form for a number of hours equal to half your Druid level or until you use Wild Shape again, have the [Incapacitated](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition, or die. You can also leave the form early as a Bonus Action.

**_Number of Uses._** You can use Wild Shape twice. You regain one expended use when you finish a [Short Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

You gain additional uses when you reach certain Druid levels, as shown in the Wild Shape column of the [Druid Features table](#DruidFeatures).

**_Known Forms._** You know four Beast forms for this feature, chosen from among Beast stat blocks that have a maximum Challenge Rating of 1/4 and that lack a Fly Speed (see [appendix B](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/creature-stat-blocks/) for stat block options). The [Rat](/monsters/4775836-rat), [Riding Horse](/monsters/4775839-riding-horse), [Spider](/monsters/4775844-spider), and [Wolf](/monsters/4775850-wolf) are recommended. Whenever you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest), you can replace one of your known forms with another eligible form.

When you reach certain Druid levels, your number of known forms and the maximum Challenge Rating for those forms increases, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. In addition, starting at level 8, you can adopt a form that has a Fly Speed.

When choosing known forms, you may look in the [Monster Manual](/sources/dnd/mm-2024) or elsewhere for eligible Beasts if the Dungeon Master permits you to do so.

|     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
##### [](#BeastShapes)Beast Shapes
| Druid Level | Known Forms | Max CR | Fly Speed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2   | 4   | 1/4 | No  |
| 4   | 6   | 1/2 | No  |
| 8   | 8   | 1   | Yes |

**_Rules While Shape-Shifted._** While in a form, you retain your personality, memories, and ability to speak, and the following rules apply:

**Temporary Hit Points.** When you assume a Wild Shape form, you gain a number of [Temporary Hit Points](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#TemporaryHitPoints) equal to your Druid level.

**Game Statistics.** Your game statistics are replaced by the Beast’s stat block, but you retain your creature type; Hit Points; Hit Point Dice; Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores; class features; languages; and feats. You also retain your skill and saving throw proficiencies and use your Proficiency Bonus for them, in addition to gaining the proficiencies of the creature. If a skill or saving throw modifier in the Beast’s stat block is higher than yours, use the one in the stat block.

**No Spellcasting.** You can’t cast spells, but shape-shifting doesn’t break your [Concentration](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration) or otherwise interfere with a spell you’ve already cast.

**Objects.** Your ability to handle objects is determined by the form’s limbs rather than your own. In addition, you choose whether your equipment falls in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it’s practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment based on the creature’s size and shape. Your equipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with the form. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect while you’re in that form.

#### [](#Level2WildCompanion)Level 2: Wild Companion

You can summon a nature spirit that assumes an animal form to aid you. As a [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action, you can expend a spell slot or a use of Wild Shape to cast the [Find Familiar](/spells/2618877-find-familiar) spell without Material components.

When you cast the spell in this way, the familiar is Fey and disappears when you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

#### [](#Level3DruidSubclass)Level 3: Druid Subclass

You gain a Druid subclass of your choice. The [Circle of the Land](#CircleoftheLand), [Circle of the Moon](#CircleoftheMoon), [Circle of the Sea](#CircleoftheSea), and [Circle of the Stars](#CircleoftheStars) subclasses are detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Druid levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Druid level or lower.

#### [](#Level4DruidAbilityScoreImprovement)Level 4: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see [chapter 5](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/feats#AbilityScoreImprovement)) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Druid levels 8, 12, and 16.

#### [](#Level5WildResurgence)Level 5: Wild Resurgence

Once on each of your turns, if you have no uses of Wild Shape left, you can give yourself one use by expending a spell slot (no action required).

In addition, you can expend one use of Wild Shape (no action required) to give yourself a level 1 spell slot, but you can’t do so again until you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

#### [](#Level7ElementalFury)Level 7: Elemental Fury

The might of the elements flows through you. You gain one of the following options of your choice.

**_Potent Spellcasting._** Add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any Druid cantrip.

**_Primal Strike._** Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with an attack roll using a weapon or a Beast form’s attack in Wild Shape, you can cause the target to take an extra 1d8 Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Thunder damage (choose when you hit).

#### [](#Level15ImprovedElementalFury)Level 15: Improved Elemental Fury

The option you chose for Elemental Fury grows more powerful, as detailed below.

**_Potent Spellcasting._** When you cast a Druid cantrip with a range of 10 feet or greater, the spell’s range increases by 300 feet.

**_Primal Strike._** The extra damage of your Primal Strike increases to 2d8.

#### [](#Level18BeastSpells)Level 18: Beast Spells

While using Wild Shape, you can cast spells in Beast form, except for any spell that has a Material component with a cost specified or that consumes its Material component.

#### [](#Level19DruidEpicBoon)Level 19: Epic Boon

You gain an Epic Boon feat (see [chapter 5](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/feats#EpicBoonFeats)) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. [Boon of Dimensional Travel](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/feats#BoonofDimensionalTravel) is recommended.

#### [](#Level20Archdruid)Level 20: Archdruid

The vitality of nature constantly blooms within you, granting you the following benefits.

**_Evergreen Wild Shape._** Whenever you roll [Initiative](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Initiative) and have no uses of Wild Shape left, you regain one expended use of it.

**_Nature Magician._** You can convert uses of Wild Shape into a spell slot (no action required). Choose a number of your unexpended uses of Wild Shape and convert them into a single spell slot, with each use contributing 2 spell levels. For example, if you convert two uses of Wild Shape, you produce a level 4 spell slot. Once you use this benefit, you can’t do so again until you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

**_Longevity._** The primal magic that you wield causes you to age more slowly. For every ten years that pass, your body ages only one year.

### [](#DruidSubclasses)Druid Subclasses

A Druid subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Druid levels, as specified in the subclass. Druids form loose associations, which they call circles. This section presents the [Circle of the Land](#CircleoftheLand), [Circle of the Moon](#CircleoftheMoon), [Circle of the Sea](#CircleoftheSea), and [Circle of the Stars](#CircleoftheStars) subclasses.

#### [](#CircleoftheLand)Circle of the Land

_Celebrate Connection to the Natural World_

The Circle of the Land comprises mystics and sages who safeguard ancient knowledge and rites. These Druids meet within sacred circles of trees or standing stones to whisper primal secrets in Druidic. The circle’s wisest members preside as the chief priests of their communities.

##### [](#Level3LandsAid)Level 3: Land’s Aid

As a [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape and choose a point within 60 feet of yourself. Vitality-giving flowers and life-draining thorns appear for a moment in a 10-foot-radius [Sphere](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#SphereAreaofEffect) centered on that point. Each creature of your choice in the Sphere must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC, taking 2d6 Necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. One creature of your choice in that area regains 2d6 Hit Points.

The damage and healing increase by 1d6 when you reach Druid levels 10 (3d6) and 14 (4d6).

##### [](#Level6NaturalRecovery)Level 6: Natural Recovery

You can cast one of the level 1+ spells that you have prepared from your Circle Spells feature without expending a spell slot, and you must finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest) before you do so again.

In addition, when you finish a [Short Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest), you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your Druid level (round up), and none of them can be level 6+. For example, if you’re a level 6 Druid, you can recover up to three levels’ worth of spell slots. You can recover a level 3 spell slot, a level 2 and a level 1 spell slot, or three level 1 spell slots. Once you recover spell slots with this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest.

##### [](#Level10NaturesWard)Level 10: Nature’s Ward

They last there for 1 minute or until you have the [Incapacitated](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition or die. You and your allies have [Half Cover](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Cover) while in that area, and your allies gain the current Resistance of your Nature’s Ward while there.

As a Bonus Action, you can move the Cube up to 60 feet to ground within 120 feet of yourself.

#### [](#CircleoftheMoon)Circle of the Moon

_Adopt Animal Forms to Guard the Wilds_

Druids of the Circle of the Moon draw on lunar magic to transform themselves. Their order gathers under the moon to share news and perform rituals.

Changeable as the moon, a Druid of this circle might prowl as a great cat one night, soar over the treetops as an eagle the next day, and then crash through undergrowth as a bear to drive off a trespassing monster. The wild is in the Druid’s blood.

##### [](#Level3CircleForms)Level 3: Circle Forms

You can channel lunar magic when you assume a Wild Shape form, granting you the benefits below.

**_Challenge Rating._** The maximum Challenge Rating for the form equals your Druid level divided by 3 (round down).

**_Armor Class._** Until you leave the form, your AC equals 13 plus your Wisdom modifier if that total is higher than the Beast’s AC.

**_Temporary Hit Points._** You gain a number of [Temporary Hit Points](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#TemporaryHitPoints) equal to three times your Druid level.

##### [](#Level3CircleoftheMoonSpells)Level 3: Circle of the Moon Spells

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

#### [](#CircleoftheSea)Circle of the Sea

_Become One with Tides and Storms_

Druids of the Circle of the Sea draw on the tempestuous forces of oceans and storms. Some view themselves as embodiments of nature’s wrath, seeking vengeance against those who despoil nature. Others seek mystical unity with nature by attuning themselves to the ebb and flow of the tides, following the rush of currents and waves and listening to the inscrutable whispers and roars of the winds.

##### [](#Level3CircleoftheSeaSpells)Level 3: Circle of the Sea Spells

When you reach a Druid level specified in the Circle of the Sea Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

As a Bonus Action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape to manifest a 5-foot [Emanation](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#EmanationAreaofEffect) that takes the form of ocean spray that surrounds you for 10 minutes. It ends early if you dismiss it (no action required), manifest it again, or have the [Incapacitated](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition.

When you manifest the Emanation and as a Bonus Action on your subsequent turns, you can choose another creature you can see in the Emanation. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or take Cold damage and, if the creature is Large or smaller, be pushed up to 15 feet away from you. To determine this damage, roll a number of d6s equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of one die).

**_Flight._** You gain a Fly Speed equal to your Speed.

##### [](#Level14OceanicGift)Level 14: Oceanic Gift

Instead of manifesting the [Emanation](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#EmanationAreaofEffect) of Wrath of the Sea around yourself, you can manifest it around one willing creature within 60 feet of yourself. That creature gains all the benefits of the Emanation and uses your spell save DC and Wisdom modifier for it.

In addition, you can manifest the Emanation around both the other creature and yourself if you expend two uses of your Wild Shape instead of one when manifesting it.

#### [](#CircleoftheStars)Circle of the Stars

_Harness Secrets Hidden in Constellations_

The Circle of the Stars has tracked heavenly patterns since time immemorial, discovering secrets hidden amid the constellations. By understanding these secrets, the Druids of this circle seek to harness the powers of the cosmos.

##### [](#Level3StarMap)Level 3: Star Map

You’ve created a star chart as part of your heavenly studies. It is a Tiny object, and you can use it as a Spellcasting Focus for your Druid spells. You determine its form by rolling on the Star Map table or by choosing one.

While holding the map, you have the [Guidance](/spells/2618971-guidance) and [Guiding Bolt](/spells/2619136-guiding-bolt) spells prepared, and you can cast _Guiding Bolt_ without expending a spell slot. You can cast it in that way a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

If you lose the map, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to magically create a replacement. This ceremony can be performed during a Short or Long Rest, and it destroys the previous map.

##### [](#Level3StarryForm)Level 3: Starry Form

As a Bonus Action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature to take on a starry form rather than shape-shifting.

While in your starry form, you retain your game statistics, but your body becomes luminous, your joints glimmer like stars, and glowing lines connect them as on a star chart. This form sheds [Bright Light](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BrightLight) in a 10-foot radius and [Dim Light](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DimLight) for an additional 10 feet. The form lasts for 10 minutes. It ends early if you dismiss it (no action required), have the [Incapacitated](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition, or use this feature again.

Whenever you assume your starry form, choose which of the following constellations glimmers on your body; your choice gives you certain benefits while in the form.

**_Archer._** A constellation of an archer appears on you. When you activate this form and as a Bonus Action on your subsequent turns while it lasts, you can make a ranged spell attack, hurling a luminous arrow that targets one creature within 60 feet of yourself. On a hit, the attack deals Radiant damage equal to 1d8 plus your Wisdom modifier.

**_Chalice._** A constellation of a life-giving goblet appears on you. Whenever you cast a spell using a spell slot that restores Hit Points to a creature, you or another creature within 30 feet of you can regain Hit Points equal to 1d8 plus your Wisdom modifier.

**_Dragon._** A constellation of a wise dragon appears on you. When you make an Intelligence or a Wisdom check or a Constitution saving throw to maintain [Concentration](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration), you can treat a roll of 9 or lower on the d20 as a 10.

##### [](#Level6CosmicOmen)Level 6: Cosmic Omen

Whenever you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest), you can consult your Star Map for omens and roll a die. Until you finish your next Long Rest, you gain access to a special Reaction based on whether you rolled an even or an odd number on the die:

**_Weal (Even)._** Whenever a creature you can see within 30 feet of you is about to make a [D20 Test](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#D20Test), you can take a Reaction to roll 1d6 and add the number rolled to the total.

**_Woe (Odd)._** Whenever a creature you can see within 30 feet of you is about to make a D20 Test, you can take a Reaction to roll 1d6 and subtract the number rolled from the total.

You can use this Reaction a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

##### [](#Level10TwinklingConstellations)Level 10: Twinkling Constellations

The constellations of your Starry Form improve. The 1d8 of the Archer and the Chalice becomes 2d8, and while the Dragon is active, you have a Fly Speed of 20 feet and can hover.

Moreover, at the start of each of your turns while in your Starry Form, you can change which constellation glimmers on your body.

##### [](#Level14FullofStars)Level 14: Full of Stars

Fighters rule many battlefields. Questing knights, royal champions, elite soldiers, and hardened mercenaries—as Fighters, they all share an unparalleled prowess with weapons and armor. And they are well acquainted with death, both meting it out and defying it.

Fighters master various weapon techniques, and a well-equipped Fighter always has the right tool at hand for any combat situation. Likewise, a Fighter is adept with every form of armor. Beyond that basic degree of familiarity, each Fighter specializes in certain styles of combat. Some concentrate on archery, some on fighting with two weapons at once, and some on augmenting their martial skills with magic. This combination of broad ability and extensive specialization makes Fighters superior combatants.

Any features in this subclass that use a Psionic Energy Die use only the dice from this subclass. Some of your powers expend the Psionic Energy Die, as specified in a power’s description, and you can’t use a power if it requires you to use a die when all your Psionic Energy Dice are expended.

You regain one of your expended Psionic Energy Dice when you finish a [Short Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest), and you regain all of them when you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

**_Protective Field._** When you or another creature you can see within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can take a Reaction to expend one Psionic Energy Die, roll the die, and reduce the damage taken by the number rolled plus your Intelligence modifier (minimum reduction of 1), as you create a momentary shield of telekinetic force.

**_Psionic Strike._** You can propel your weapons with psionic force. Once on each of your turns, immediately after you hit a target within 30 feet of yourself with an attack and deal damage to it with a weapon, you can expend one Psionic Energy Die, rolling it and dealing Force damage to the target equal to the number rolled plus your Intelligence modifier.

**_Telekinetic Movement._** You can move an object or a creature with your mind. As a [Magic](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action, choose one target you can see within 30 feet of yourself; the target must be a loose object that is Large or smaller or one willing creature other than you. You transport the target up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. Alternatively, if the target is a Tiny object, you can transport it to or from your hand.

Once you take this action, you can’t do so again until you finish a [Short](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest) or [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest) unless you expend a Psionic Energy Die (no action required) to restore your use of it.

##### [](#Level7TelekineticAdept)Level 7: Telekinetic Adept

You have mastered new ways to use your telekinetic abilities, detailed below.

**_Psi-Powered Leap._** As a Bonus Action, you gain a Fly Speed equal to twice your Speed until the end of the current turn. Once you take this Bonus Action, you can’t do so again until you finish a [Short](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest) or [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest) unless you expend a Psionic Energy Die (no action required) to restore your use of it.

**_Telekinetic Thrust._** When you deal damage to a target with your Psionic Strike, you can force the target to make a Strength saving throw (DC 8 plus your Intelligence modifier and Proficiency Bonus). On a failed save, you can give the target the [Prone](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ProneCondition) condition or transport it up to 10 feet horizontally.

##### [](#Level10GuardedMind)Level 10: Guarded Mind

You have Resistance to Psychic damage. Moreover, if you start your turn with the [Charmed](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CharmedCondition) or [Frightened](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition) condition, you can expend a Psionic Energy Die (no action required) and end every effect on yourself giving you those conditions.

##### [](#Level15BulwarkofForce)Level 15: Bulwark of Force

You can shield yourself and others with telekinetic force. As a Bonus Action, you can choose creatures, including yourself, within 30 feet of yourself, up to a number of creatures equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one creature). Each of the chosen creatures has [Half Cover](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Cover) for 1 minute or until you have the [Incapacitated](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition.

Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest) unless you expend a Psionic Energy Die (no action required) to restore your use of it.

##### [](#Level18TelekineticMaster)Level 18: Telekinetic Master

You always have the [Telekinesis](/spells/2619157-telekinesis) spell prepared. With this feature, you can cast it without a spell slot or components, and your spellcasting ability for it is Intelligence. On each of your turns while you maintain [Concentration](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration) on it, including the turn when you cast it, you can make one attack with a weapon as a Bonus Action.

Once you cast the spell with this feature, you can’t do so in this way again until you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest) unless you expend a Psionic Energy Die (no action required) to restore your use of it.

Monks use rigorous combat training and mental discipline to align themselves with the multiverse and focus their internal reservoirs of power. Different Monks conceptualize this power in various ways: as breath, energy, life force, essence, or self, for example. Whether channeled as a striking display of martial prowess or as a subtler manifestation of defense and speed, this power infuses all that a Monk does.

Monks focus their internal power to create extraordinary, even supernatural, effects. They channel uncanny speed and strength into their attacks, with or without the use of weapons. In a Monk’s hands, even the most basic weapons can become sophisticated implements of combat mastery.

Many Monks find that a structured life of ascetic withdrawal helps them cultivate the physical and mental focus they need to harness their power. Other Monks believe that immersing themselves in the vibrant confusion of life helps to fuel their determination and discipline.

Monks generally view adventures as tests of their physical and mental development. They are driven by a desire to accomplish a greater mission than merely slaying monsters and plundering treasure; they strive to turn themselves into living weapons.

#### [](#Level1MartialArts)Level 1: Martial Arts

Your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use your [Unarmed Strike](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike) and Monk weapons, which are the following:

*   Simple Melee weapons

You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only Monk weapons and you aren’t wearing armor or wielding a Shield.

**_Bonus Unarmed Strike._** You can make an [Unarmed Strike](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike) as a Bonus Action.

**_Martial Arts Die._** You can roll 1d6 in place of the normal damage of your [Unarmed Strike](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike) or Monk weapons. This die changes as you gain Monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk Features table.

**_Dexterous Attacks._** You can use your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier for the attack and damage rolls of your [Unarmed Strikes](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike) and Monk weapons. In addition, when you use the Grapple or Shove option of your Unarmed Strike, you can use your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier to determine the save DC.

#### [](#Level1MonkUnarmoredDefense)Level 1: Unarmored Defense

While you aren’t wearing armor or wielding a Shield, your base [Armor Class](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ArmorClass) equals 10 plus your Dexterity and Wisdom modifiers.

#### [](#Level2MonksFocus)Level 2: Monk’s Focus

Your focus and martial training allow you to harness a well of extraordinary energy within yourself. This energy is represented by Focus Points. Your Monk level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the Focus Points column of the [Monk Features table](#MonkFeatures).

You can expend these points to enhance or fuel certain Monk features. You start knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind, each of which is detailed below.

When you expend a Focus Point, it is unavailable until you finish a [Short](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest) or [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest), at the end of which you regain all your expended points.

Some features that use Focus Points require your target to make a saving throw. The save DC equals 8 plus your Wisdom modifier and Proficiency Bonus.

**_Flurry of Blows._** You can expend 1 Focus Point to make two [Unarmed Strikes](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike) as a Bonus Action.

**_Patient Defense._** You can take the [Disengage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DisengageAction) action as a Bonus Action.

**_Step of the Wind._** You can take the [Dash](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DashAction) action as a Bonus Action. Alternatively, you can expend 1 Focus Point to take both the [Disengage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DisengageAction) and [Dash](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DashAction) actions as a Bonus Action, and your jump distance is doubled for the turn.

#### [](#Level2MonkUnarmoredMovement)Level 2: Unarmored Movement

#### [](#Level2UncannyMetabolism)Level 2: Uncanny Metabolism

When you roll [Initiative](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Initiative), you can regain all expended Focus Points. When you do so, roll your Martial Arts die, and regain a number of Hit Points equal to your Monk level plus the number rolled.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a [Long Rest](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

#### [](#Level3DeflectAttacks)Level 3: Deflect Attacks

When an attack roll hits you and its damage includes Bludgeoning, Piercing, or Slashing damage, you can take a Reaction to reduce the attack’s total damage against you. The reduction equals 1d10 plus your Dexterity modifier and Monk level.

If you reduce the damage to 0, you can expend 1 Focus Point to redirect some of the attack’s force. If you do so, choose a creature you can see within 5 feet of yourself if the attack was a melee attack or a creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself that isn’t behind [Total Cover](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Cover) if the attack was a ranged attack. That creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take damage equal to two rolls of your Martial Arts die plus your Dexterity modifier. The damage is the same type dealt by the attack.

#### [](#Level3MonkSubclass)Level 3: Monk Subclass

You gain a Monk subclass of your choice. The [Warrior of Mercy](#WarriorofMercy), [Warrior of Shadow](#WarriorofShadow), [Warrior of the Elements](#WarrioroftheElements), and [Warrior of the Open Hand](#WarrioroftheOpenHand) subclasses are detailed after this class’s description.

#### [](#Level4MonkAbilityScoreImprovement)Level 4: Ability Score Improvement

Once per turn when you hit a creature with a Monk weapon or an [Unarmed Strike](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike), you can expend 1 Focus Point to attempt a stunning strike. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target has the [Stunned](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#StunnedCondition) condition until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, the target’s Speed is halved until the start of your next turn, and the next attack roll made against the target before then has [Advantage](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Advantage).

#### [](#Level6EmpoweredStrikes)Level 6: Empowered Strikes

Whenever you deal damage with your [Unarmed Strike](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike), it can deal your choice of Force damage or its normal damage type.

#### [](#Level7MonkEvasion)Level 7: Evasion

When you’re subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw and only half damage if you fail.

You don’t benefit from this feature if you have the [Incapacitated](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition.

#### [](#Level9AcrobaticMovement)Level 9: Acrobatic Movement

While you aren’t wearing armor or wielding a Shield, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during the movement.

#### [](#Level10HeightenedFocus)Level 10: Heightened Focus

Your Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind gain the following benefits.

**_Flurry of Blows._** You can expend 1 Focus Point to use Flurry of Blows and make three [Unarmed Strikes](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike) with it instead of two.

**_Patient Defense._** When you expend a Focus Point to use Patient Defense, you gain a number of [Temporary Hit Points](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#TemporaryHitPoints) equal to two rolls of your Martial Arts die.

**_Step of the Wind._** When you expend a Focus Point to use Step of the Wind, you can choose a willing creature within 5 feet of yourself that is Large or smaller. You move the creature with you until the end of your turn. The creature’s movement doesn’t provoke [Opportunity Attacks](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#OpportunityAttack).

#### [](#Level10SelfRestoration)Level 10: Self-Restoration

Through sheer force of will, you can remove one of the following conditions from yourself at the end of each of your turns: [Charmed](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CharmedCondition), [Frightened](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition), or [Poisoned](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#PoisonedCondition).

In addition, forgoing food and drink doesn’t give you levels of [Exhaustion](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ExhaustionCondition).

#### [](#Level13DeflectEnergy)Level 13: Deflect Energy

You can now use your Deflect Attacks feature against attacks that deal any damage type, not just Bludgeoning, Piercing, or Slashing.

#### [](#Level14DisciplinedSurvivor)Level 14: Disciplined Survivor

Your physical and mental discipline grant you proficiency in all saving throws.

Additionally, whenever you make a saving throw and fail, you can expend 1 Focus Point to reroll it, and you must use the new roll.

#### [](#Level15PerfectFocus)Level 15: Perfect Focus

When you roll [Initiative](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Initiative) and don’t use Uncanny Metabolism, you regain expended Focus Points until you have 4 if you have 3 or fewer.

#### [](#Level18SuperiorDefense)Level 18: Superior Defense

At the start of your turn, you can expend 3 Focus Points to bolster yourself against harm for 1 minute or until you have the [Incapacitated](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition. During that time, you have Resistance to all damage except Force damage.

**_Empowered Strikes._** Once on each of your turns, you can deal extra damage to a target equal to one roll of your Martial Arts die when you hit it with an [Unarmed Strike](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike). The extra damage is the same type dealt by that strike.

When you hit a creature with an [Unarmed Strike](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike), you can expend 4 Focus Points to start these imperceptible vibrations, which last for a number of days equal to your Monk level. The vibrations are harmless unless you take an action to end them. Alternatively, when you take the [Attack](/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#AttackAction) action on your turn, you can forgo one of the attacks to end the vibrations. To end them, you and the target must be on the same plane of existence. When you end them, the target must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 10d12 Force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

You can have only one creature under the effect of this feature at a time. You can end the vibrations harmlessly (no action required).
